Manage users’ accounts
Control accounts is a paid feature, which you can enable by upgrading your workspace to the Enterprise plan.
Gain complete control over users’ accounts on your workspace, so that you can:
- See when user joined
- Deactivate user’s API key
- Log in as user (if you’re on subdomain, you’ll only be able to log in as that user inside your workspace)
- Stop timer for another user
Only the workspace owner has access to the Accounts tab in the Workspace settings.
Deactivate API key #
This page doesn’t display the API keys themselves, but it shows how many active keys each user has.
If you need to stop an API from working:
- Click the three-dots menu next to the user whose API key you want to deactivate
- Choose Deactivate API key
- Click Deactivate to confirm the action
After being deactivated, that API key can no longer be used and its status will be automatically updated on the Manage API keys page.
