Users can’t request Time Off
If a team member is unable to submit a time off request, here are the most common reasons and how to resolve them.
The user is not assigned to the time off policy #
If a user is not assigned to any time off policy, they won’t be able to request time off.
Admins can check this by following the steps below:
- Navigate to the Time Off page
- Click on the Cog icon and select “Manage policies”
- Click on the three dots and select “Edit”
- Make sure that the user is listed under the “Assignees” menu
The user does not have sufficient time off balance #
Even if a user is assigned to the policy, they won’t be able to request time off if their balance is zero.
To check their balance:
- Navigate to the Time Off page from the sidebar
- Click on the Balance tab
- Filter by User or Policy to view the available balance
If they don’t have enough balance:
- Add to their balance manually by clicking on the three dots
- Or, go to the policy settings and enable “Allow negative balance” to let users request time off even if they don’t have enough available days
