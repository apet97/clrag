Approve team’s time entries
As a Team or Project manager, you play a crucial role in ensuring that your team’s time entries are accurately tracked, reviewed, and approved. This guide will walk you through the process of managing time entry approvals, ensuring that time and budget allocations for projects are accurate and well-documented.
What is time entry approval? #
Approving time entries is the process where Admins, Project managers, or Team managers review and approve or reject time entries submitted by team members. The goal is to ensure that time spent on projects is correctly tracked, budgeted, and allocated for accurate reporting and invoicing.
Time approvals are available on Standard and higher subscription plans. The ability to approve expenses requires a Pro or higher plan.
Roles and permissions #
In your workspace, the ability to approve time and expenses is determined by your role and the permissions.
- Team managers (if enabled): Can approve time entries and expenses for users they manage.
- Project managers (if enabled): Can approve time entries for team members working on the projects they manage.
Admin can modify these permissions by navigating to the Workspace Settings > Permissions tab and configuring the Who can approve submitted timesheets and expenses section.
Recap of roles and permissions #
- Team managers: Can approve time for their team members
- Project managers: Can approve time for team members working on their projects.
If a user holds both the Team manager and Project manager roles, they will have combined permissions, giving them the ability to approve time for both their team and the projects they manage.
