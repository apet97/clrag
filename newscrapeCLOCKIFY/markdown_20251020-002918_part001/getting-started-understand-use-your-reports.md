Understand & use your reports
This guide will walk regular users through how to view, interpret, and filter their time-tracking reports in Clockify. You will learn how to access various types of reports, filter by specific criteria like date, project, or client, and customize reports to fit your needs.
Overview of reports #
Clockify offers several types of reports to help you track time and expenses:
- Summary report
This report groups your time entries by various criteria, such as project, client, user, tag, or date. It’s ideal for getting an overview of your time entries over a specific date range. - Detailed report
This report shows all the details of your time entries, without grouping or summarizing. It provides a line-by-line breakdown of each time entry. - Weekly report
Weekly report is great for weekly tracking, since it shows time entries grouped by user or project within a fixed week range.
Navigate the reports #
To access and navigate the reports section:
- Go to the Reports page in the sidebar
If the Reports page is not visible, it might be restricted by your workspace admins. - Choose between the Summary, Detailed, or Weekly report, depending on your needs
Filter your reports #
Clockify allows you to filter your reports by several criteria to get the data you need. Here’s how to filter your reports:
- Choose time period
At the top of the Report page, select the Calendar date range for the report. You can choose custom date ranges or predefined options like last week or this month. - Filter by Project, Client, or User
Project: Filter by active or archived projects
Client: Filter by active or archived clients
User: Filter by specific team members, or show all users (active/inactive) - Filter by entry status, tag, or task
You can filter time entries by status (approved, pending, etc.), description, tag, or task to get a more granular view of the time tracked.
Reports data #
Once you have applied the relevant filters, the report will display the following key data points:
- Total time worked
This is the total amount of time tracked during the selected period. It includes both billable and non-billable hours. - Billable hours
Billable hours are the time entries that are considered chargeable to a client or project. These will be separated from non-billable hours in the report. - Project summaries
If you group your report by project, you will see a breakdown of total time tracked for each project. This is useful for understanding how much time was spent on each project. - Total amount
For billable hours, the report will also display the total monetary value based on the rate set for each project or client.
Customize and export reports #
Clockify offers a variety of options for customizing and exporting your reports:
- Customize the report for export
You can adjust the filters and groupings to create a report tailored to your needs, whether you need a summary, detailed breakdown, or weekly overview. - Export report in one of the formats (PDF, Excel or CSV)
- Save report
For more precise reporting, you can enable or disable rounding for the time entries in the report if you want time tracked in minutes to be rounded up or down to the nearest increment.
