Team overview
As a Manager in Clockify, one of your key responsibilities is to invite and manage the members of your team.
Use these instructions to learn how to:
- Invite team members to your workspace
- Manage team profiles and roles after the invitation is accepted
Only Admins can invite new users and manage roles within the workspace. As a Manager, you have certain permissions, but you cannot invite users or edit certain profile settings.
To manage your team:
- Navigate to the Team page
- The page displays a list of all the current users in your workspace (Full and Limited)
As a Manager, you have specific permissions that give you access to manage your team without the ability to make major administrative changes. Here’s a breakdown of what you can and cannot do:
Project Manager #
- Can access: Team page, Limited page, member hourly rates, cost rates, roles, and group members.
- Cannot: Add new members, deactivate users, transfer ownership, edit member profiles, remove deactivated members, or export members.
