Attendance report
Attendance report allows users to track their team’s daily attendance, including their presence, absence, overtime work and more.
By using Attendance report you can see when team members started and finished working, how much they worked each day, breakdown of cost and billable amounts for their scheduled and tracked time, who took time off or didn’t log hours and who worked overtime or below their working capacity.
Attendance report is a paid feature, which you can enable by upgrading your workspace to Standard, Pro or Enterprise plan and is available for users with an admin, or team manager role.
Admins can see all users, while team managers can only see the users they manage.
