Edit users’ profiles
Update your team member’s details without the need to ask them, or wait for an update.
Profile editing is a paid feature available to Owners and Admins by upgrading the workspace to any of the paid plans.
To edit user’s profile:
- Go to the Team page
- Click on the three dots next to the user’s name
- Select Edit profile
- Make the changes (week start*, capacity, working days, entering user’s ID or setting the type of employment to part-time)
- Save changes
Important notes:
- Users can only edit their email, profile picture and username themselves on their CAKE.com Account page
- Any changes made to the week start or working days are emailed to the user after being saved
- Week start* cannot be changed if there are pending approvals
- If you have custom user fields (e.g. employee ID, department), you can edit these directly in the profile
Week start set up on the Team page overrides the default one in the Workspace settings.
You can’t edit user’s profile if:
- User belongs to more than one workspace
- User’s account is inactive
- User hasn’t yet accepted your workspace invitation
- User is assigned the Owner role
Daily capacity and working days can be edited regardless of the number of workspaces that the user has.
Leave workspace #
If a user no longer needs access to a workspace, they can leave it by following these steps:
- Click on a workspace name in the upper left corner to open the workspace picker
- Choose Manage workspaces
You’ll be redirected to the Workspaces page in your CAKE.com Account where you can complete the action.
