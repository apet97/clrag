Improve performance and compatibility in Clockify
To get the best experience when using Clockify’s web and kiosk apps, it’s important to use supported browsers and ensure that critical services and emails are not blocked by your system or email provider.
Supported browsers #
Clockify works best on the two most recent versions of the following browsers:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Edge (Chromium-based)
- Safari
- iOS
- Android
Using outdated browsers may result in limited functionality or unexpected errors. To check your browser version:
- Open your browser
- Go to Settings -> About
- Update to the latest version if needed
Optimize browser performance #
For the smoothest experience:
- Enable cookies
- Disable browser extensions that might interfere with Clockify
- Make sure you’re using a compatible browser and up an up-to-date version
Whitelist Clockify domains and IP addresses #
If you’re not getting Clockify emails or you’re experiencing slow performance, your email filters or firewalls might be blocking our service. To fix this, whitelist our IP addresses and add our domains to your email’s safe sender list.
