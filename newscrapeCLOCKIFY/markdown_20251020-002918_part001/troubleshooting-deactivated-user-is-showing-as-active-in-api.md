Deactivated user is displayed as active in API
If you encounter an issue where a deactivated user is showing as ACTIVE
via the API, itâ€™s important to understand how Clockify handles user status.
Explanation #
When a user is deactivated from a specific workspace, their account is not deleted from the Clockify database.
If the user is a member of multiple workspaces, their account will remain active in other workspaces.
Solution #
- Ensure you are using the correct endpoint:
- Workspace users:
GET /v1/workspaces/{{ws id}}/users
- Workspace users:
- To check membership status in a specific workspace, use the query parameter
?memberships=ALL
:- Example:
GET /v1/workspaces/{{ws id}}/users/?memberships=ALL
- Example:
If the status still shows ACTIVE
, it is expected behavior. The user is still considered active in the system due to their presence in other workspaces.
