I can’t add time
If you are unable to add time, there are a few things you can check to fix the issue.
The “Force Timer” feature is enabled #
When Force Timer is turned on, you can only track time using the timer; manual entries are disabled.
- If you see an error message ‘Manual time tracking is disabled’, this might be the cause
- You’ll need to use the timer instead, or ask your workspace admin to disable Force Timer
How to find the admin of a workspace:
- Navigate to the Team tab
- Look for a user with an Admin role assigned
The “Lock Timesheets” feature is enabled #
If the Lock Timesheets is enabled in the workspace settings, you won’t be able to edit the time for locked dates.
- You’ll see a message saying the date is locked on the timesheet
- You won’t be able to select that particular date on the Time Tracker page, as it will be grayed out
In this case, ask your workspace admin to:
- Add the time manually for you, or
- Temporarily disable Lock Timesheets so you can enter it yourself
Device time is not synced #
If your device clock isn’t synced with real time, the system may prevent you from adding time.
- Visit time.is to check if your device time is accurate
- If it’s off, update your device’s clock
- Try adding time again
For workspace admins
If your team reports they can’t add time manually:
- Click on the three dots next to your workspace name and select “Workspace Settings.”
- Navigate to the Permissions tab
- Scroll all the way down and check if the Force Timer and Lock Timesheet features are enabled
- Disable the features if needed
To add time for your team members:
- Navigate to the detailed report
- Select the “Add time for others” option
- Select the team member and add time for them
