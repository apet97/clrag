Android app
Install Clockify on your Android and track time while on the go.
For step-by-step guidance on using Clockify on your Android device, watch the video and follow the instructions below.
Log in #
To start tracking time in the app, you’ll first need to log in to your Clockify account.
There are a couple of ways in which you can do that:
- Enter email you used to create Clockify account and Continue with Email
- Choose to Continue with Google if you’ve associated your Clockify account with your Google account
If you don’t have a Clockify account yet, you can create it by tapping the Sign up button in the upper right corner.
Continue with email #
- Enter Clockify account email
- Tap on Continue with Email
- Enter verification code you’ve got in the verification email
Continue with Google #
- Choose the Google email
- Or create one you used to create your Clockify account
You’ll be redirected to the Time Tracker screen right away and can start tracking time.
Custom domain and subdomain login #
If you use a custom domain or a subdomain, you can also use the Android app.
- Open the app and enter your Clockify account email
- Choose the workspace associated with your subdomain/custom domain
- You’ll be redirected to the subdomain in question and required to log in once again to access your workspace
After the successful verification, you’ll be redirected to the Time Tracker screen and you can start tracking time again.
Time tracking #
It is possible to track your time in Clockify Android app in two different ways, either by using a timer or adding time manually.
Clockify groups similar time entries under one expandable entry. If you wish to see entries in chronological order, go to Profile settings > Preferences in the web app and turn off Group similar time entries.
Autocomplete
There’s an autocomplete option available when you tap on an entry and start typing a description.
Timer mode #
To start a timer:
- Tap + button in the lower right corner and a time entry screen will appear
- Choose and tap the Play button on the bottom right corner to begin working
- Fill the details (description, project, task, billability, tags)
- Tap the Stop button to stop the timer and save the time entry or the Discard option in the upper right corner to discard the time entry
Add time manually #
To manually add a time entry:
- Tap + button in the bottom right corner
- Choose Manual option
- Type in the time to set the duration of the time entry OR
- Tap on the start/end option on the top left corner to specify start/end time, and date
- Fill in the details (description, project, task, billability, tags)
- Tap the Save button to save the time entry or the Discard button in the upper right corner to discard the time entry
You can type in the time if you tap the numbers on the scroller rather than scrolling through the numbers to get to the hour you need.
Add/subtract duration shortcuts #
In order to optimize the process of modifying entries, when adding time manually, you can easily add duration by using the shortcut buttons located below the duration field.
The following time spans can be added:
- -1h
- -0.25h
- +0.25h
- +1h
The value displayed on the shortcut buttons is based on the duration of the entry (e.g. if duration is less than an hour, the -1 button is disabled).
Click on one of the buttons, and that value will be added/subtracted from the tracked time.
Shortcut buttons are not available for running entries, only when adding time manually.
Edit time entry #
To edit a time entry simply tap on the entry itself and an Edit time entry screen will appear where you can:
- Edit start and end time, as well as the date by tapping the Start/End option in the upper left corner
- Select task and project (plus create projects and tasks from within the app)
- Edit time description
- Mark time entry as billable
- Add/remove tags (plus create them)
On the Time tracker screen, when you tap the three little dots in the time entry card you’ll find more options:
- Continue that time entry
- Duplicate that time entry
- Access the edit time entry screen and edit the time entry details
- Delete the time entry
You can also continue a previous time entry from the Time tracker list by tapping the play button on the time entry (just below the three little dots). Note that this will start a new timer with the exact same details as the entry where you tapped the play button.
Undo ‘delete’ action #
Clockify lets you undo deleted or discarded entries on multiple screens, regardless of your user role or subscription plan.
- Time Tracker: Undo discarding & deleting entries
- Timesheet: Undo deleting sheet
- Calendar: Undo discarding & deleting entries
- Expenses: Undo deleting expenses
To undo, click Undo in the snackbar after deletion or discard. Toast message for successful deletion lasts 4 seconds, during which the action can be undone.
Discarded entry
When an entry is discarded, a snackbar will appear with the message Timer cancelled. If you click Undo, a snackbar will appear with the message Entry restored and the entry will be added back to the Time Tracker list.
If you leave required fields empty and click Undo on a discarded entry, the timer will resume, and you will see the Timer screen with the required fields highlighted in red, prompting you to complete the missing information.
The Undo option restores all data, including GPS location, required fields, and screenshots.
Track breaks #
You can also track breaks via Time tracker. This option is available to all users with the Break feature enabled.
To start the break entry:
- Tap + on Time entry screen
- Choose and tap on Break
- Tap Stop to stop tracking break
Tracked break entries are marked with a break icon. If breaks and force timer are turned on, then only timer and break options are available on a tracker.

Break entry can also be started in the Offline mode.
Track holidays and time off #

Time off and holiday entries can be created by Owners and Admins on the web app.
They are distinctly displayed on Time Tracker, Timesheet, Calendar, Expenses, Time off and Reports.
For more information, check out Track holidays & time off.
Track time via widget #
This feature is available to all users on all subscription plans.
Widgets displays real-time data and provide easy access or shortcuts to certain actions for applications running on mobile devices.
To use a widget for your mobile app, you can usually just press and hold on an app icon and choose the Widgets option.
Three types of actions are available from Clockify widget:
- Start time entry with timer
- Track time again
- Track break
Timer #
With this widget, you can start and stop the timer. After you tap play, the timer starts running along with the duration. When the timer is started, there’ll be an indication if billability or tag is on and available for this time entry.
If you tap anywhere on the widget, the Time Tracker screen opens.
While Timer is running, the following time entry data is displayed:
- Description
- Project
- Task
- Client
- Tag
- Billable
If you stop the timer and all required fields are populated, this entry will be added to the Time Tracker. If all required fields are not populated, then the Timer screen opens and you will be prompted to fill out the required fields.
Custom fields are currently not available on widgets.
Track again #
This widget displays 4 most recently tracked entries. You can choose one and start the timer.
When you tap play on any of the entries, timer starts again. If you tap on any place within the widget, Clockify app opens. If you tap again on a widget with a running entry again, the timer will stop.
There is a default widget size. However, the widget can be resized (reduce size, enlarge).
If timer doesn’t have all required fields, Time entry details opens for you to fill out.
Track break #
If you’ve enabled the widget, you can see a tracking break icon alongside other icons on the widget when tracking time as a break. This way, you can easily see the difference between tracing work and break time without needing to open the app.
In this case, the time is tracked as a break entry type. The widget displays a cup that differentiates it from a regular time entry timer.

Offline mode #
You can track time in Clockify on your Android even if you’re offline.
Create time entries manually or start/stop the timer. Entries made while offline will be saved locally on your phone. Once you get back online, they’ll get synced with your web account automatically.
When you’re offline, you will only be able to see information loaded while you were online (time entries, projects, tasks, tags, etc.). So projects, tasks, and tags are available for selection if they were loaded before you went offline.
Once you’re offline, you can see, open and edit the expense, but the changes will be made once you go back online.
It’s not possible to create new projects, tasks, tags, and clients while offline.
If you notice that the app is very slow, it probably means you have an unstable internet connection. In that case, enable Force offline mode in Settings to improve performance. This will make the app behave as if it’s offline without you having to turn off your internet connection. After your turn off Force offline mode, the app will automatically sync all time entries.
If you are using the app in the offline mode, please make sure you’ve synced your time entries with the cloud prior to logging out. If you fail to do that, all the data that is not synced at the moment of logging out, will be lost.
If your access token expires while offline, you’ll be logged out when you reconnect. Unsynchronized data will automatically sync, and you’ll be notified if you were offline.
Week start #
Customize your week start, align it with your routines or cultural practices and improve your efficiency.
Default week start is set up for all Workspace members in the Workspace settings on the Web app. Owners and Admins can change this configuration for individual users on the Clockify Web app, Team page > Profile settings.
Day start #
Apart from customizing start of your week, you can also customize working hours and set up start of your day.
The default day start is set to 09:00h.
To change the default day start:
Go to the Settings screen and tap on the Day start option. Choose your preferred hour by inserting the numbers, or use a time picker option in the lower left corner. The time picker will differ based on the time format you’re set (12-hour or 24-hour).
The change you’ve made in the Android app will be automatically applied to all other platforms you use with the same account.
Changing the starting hour of your working day in Clockify will impact these features: Timesheet and Time off.
Time zone settings #
There are two ways in which you can set your time zone in the Android app:
- Choose time zone manually from the list of available time zones
The change you’ve made in the Android app will be automatically applied to all other platforms you use with the same account.
Also, if you set a time zone that is different from the time zone set on your Android device, in order to track time you’ll need to change time zone in Clockify’s Profile settings > Preferences > General so that it matches your phone’s time zone.
- Set time zone automatically
If you’d like to set your time zone automatically, the app will automatically switch to the time zone set on your Android device. This time zone will be applied to all the platforms you use with the same account.
To ensure consistency and accuracy of the time tracking and the approvals, you won’t be able to change the time zone if you have pending approval request. Once the request is approved/rejected, you’ll be able to modify the time zone.
Delete account #
You can delete your account from the Settings page:
- Go to Settings
- Scroll down to the bottom of the page and tap Delete account
- You’ll be redirected to the organization’s web page
