Manage team members’ time entries #
As a Workspace Admin or Team Manager, you have the ability to oversee and manage the time entries and expenses submitted by your team members. This includes ensuring the accuracy of tracked hours and expenses.
Manage time entries and expenses: #
- Time tracking management is available on Standard and higher plans, and can be performed by Workspace Admins and Team Managers
- Expense management is available on Pro and higher plans, and can also be handled by Workspace admins and Team managers.
You can review each team member’s time to ensure they are logging the correct hours, adjusting any inaccuracies, and verifying that the time aligns with project budgets and client agreements.
Unsubmitted time entries #
Sometimes, team members may forget to submit their time entries. As an Admin or Team manager, you can review unsubmitted time entries and send reminders.
To review tracked time and remind team members: #
- Go to Approvals page and click the Unsubmitted tab to view users
- Click Remind to submit to send reminder email
To submit tracked time:
- Click the three dots for the unsubmitted time
- Choose Submit to submit the timesheet for the user
If you go to the Weekly report page and filter by Status, you can find users who have no approved time.
Withdraw and edit approved time #
If there is an error in an approved time entry, you as an Admin can withdraw approval and edit the time.
Steps to withdraw approval and edit time:
- Navigate to Approvals and go to the Archive tab
- Find the time period to edit
- Withdraw approval:
- Click on the approval request and select Withdraw approval in the top-right corner
- Add a note explaining why the approval is being withdrawn and what changes are needed
Once approval is withdrawn, all time entries for that period will become editable again. You can then modify the time entries in the Detailed Reports section.
After withdrawing approval, a permanent copy of the approved time entries will be stored in the Withdrawn tab for auditing purposes.
Next steps:
- Get familiar with the Timesheet and Detailed reports pages
- Make sure your workspace settings are configured to allow Team managers to edit time (if desired)
- Review the Approvals section regularly to manage unsubmitted or incorrect time entries
