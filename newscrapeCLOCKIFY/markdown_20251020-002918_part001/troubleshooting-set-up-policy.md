How do I set up a policy?
In Clockify, there are two types of policies you can set up on the Time Off page.
Holiday policies #
Holiday policies are used for public holidays like Christmas Day, New Year’s Day, or any other non-working day your organization observes.
- When you assign users to a holiday policy, they’ll be automatically marked as off on those dates
- Holidays will be visible on the Timesheet, Calendar, Approvals, and Reports if the automatic time off entry creation is enabled
- Users do not need to submit a request; it’s automatic
You can also choose whether holidays:
- Occur annually
- Automatically create time entries on the day of the holiday
Time Off policies #
Time off policies are used for user-submitted requests like vacation, sick leave, personal days, etc.
- The user must submit a request in order to take time off
- Time off will only be counted once the request is approved (if required)
When creating a time off policy, you can customize settings such as:
- Whether it requires approval
- Whether time off accrues monthly or annually
- If users are allowed to take half-days
- Whether to automatically create time entries once approved
- Whether to allow negative balances
How to create a policy (both types)
- Go to the Time Off page
- Click on the cog icon in the top-right corner
- Choose either Manage Holidays or Manage Policies
- In the pop-up window, select “Create New”
- Fill in the policy name, assignees, and other relevant settings
- Save the policy
You can create as many holiday or time off policies as needed and assign them to specific individuals or entire teams.
