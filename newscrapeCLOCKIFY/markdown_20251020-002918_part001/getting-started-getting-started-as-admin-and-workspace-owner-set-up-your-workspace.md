Set up your Workspace
As a Workspace Owner or Admin, you can configure and manage the overall settings for your Workspace.
In this guide, we’ll walk you through the essential steps for configuring your Workspace, managing users, and customizing settings to meet the needs of your team.
What is a Workspace? #
A workspace is a collection of people and projects in Clockify. When you first register at Clockify, you’ll automatically get a Clockify workspace and your CAKE.com Account with an organization in it.
You can also join a Clockify workspace in an existing CAKE.com organization. A workspace contains all the time entries, projects, people, and settings.
Visibility #
Only people who are part of the Workspace can view and interact with its data. You can be a member of multiple Workspaces at once and switch between them easily.
Multiple Workspaces #
With a single Clockify account, you can create or join multiple workspaces. These workspaces are separate entities, each with their own unique set of users, projects, and time entries.
Multiple workspaces are useful when you want to have a separate account for each sub-company or a department. This is ideal if you need to segregate time tracking and projects across various teams.
For example, if you have two companies or departments, you can create two workspaces, and invite different people to each one. Then, you can switch between them as needed.
Or, you can be a team member in one workspace and track time for the company you work for, plus have a personal workspace where you’ll keep track of personal stuff and be admin.

As a Workspace Owner or Admin, you have access to configure the settings for your Workspace. To access the Workspace settings:
