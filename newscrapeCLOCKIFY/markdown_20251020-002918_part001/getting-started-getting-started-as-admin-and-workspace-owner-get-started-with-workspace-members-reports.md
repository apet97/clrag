Get started with Workspace members’ reports
As a Workspace Admin or Owner, managing reports is crucial for overseeing tracked time, project progress, and team productivity. Clockify has different types of reports that help you stay on top of your team’s work hours and expenses. This guide will walk you through how to use these reports, customize them, and export them for deeper analysis.

Types of reports in Clockify #
Clockify provides three main types of reports, each serving different purposes based on how you want to analyze your team’s work:
Summary report #
The Summary report is highly flexible and allows you to group your team’s time entries in various ways, depending on your needs. You can group data by:
- Project
- Client
- User
- Group
- Tag
- Month, Week, or Date
How to use the Summary report:
- Group by User: Get a breakdown of your employees’ hours by user, project, and task. This view helps you see how much time each team member spent on specific projects or tasks.
- Group by Date: See how many hours each employee tracked on a specific day. This is ideal if you need a daily, bi-weekly, or monthly report.
- You can select any date range at the top right corner of the report to get a custom view of your team’s hours.
Weekly report #
The Weekly report focuses on the hours tracked within a set week. It’s helpful for weekly tracking and approval workflows.
How to use the Weekly report:
- Group by User or Project: You can view hours based on individual users or specific projects.
- The report always shows data for one week at a time. However, if you want to see more than one week, you can use the Summary report and group by User and Date to see hours per day across weeks.
Detailed report #
The Detailed report provides a line-by-line view of all time entries for your team, without any grouping or summarization. This report is best for viewing all tracked time in detail and for making adjustments to time entries.
How to use the Detailed report:
- See every time entry recorded by your team
- Admins can edit team members’ time entries directly from the Detailed report
- This report can be exported in various formats, such as PDF, Excel, or CSV
Manage individual employee reports #
If you need to get data for a single employee, you can filter reports by user to generate a report specific to that individual’s hours.
Steps to generate an individual employee report:
- Open the Summary report, Detailed report, or Weekly report
- Apply the user filter to select a specific employee
- View the report for that employee’s hours, and export or analyze the data as needed
Customize reports #
Clockify’s built-in reports are flexible, but if you need even more customization, you can export the Detailed report and create customized reports using tools like pivot tables in Excel or Google Sheets.
To customize reports:
- Export the Detailed report in CSV format
- Open the file in Excel or Google sheets
- Use pivot tables or other analysis tools to organize the data in the exact format you need
This is particularly useful if you want to create more complex reports or need to combine data from different sources.
View and manage Timesheets #
If your workspace is on a paid plan, you can access Timesheets for your employees. This feature provides a summary of each team member’s hours, similar to the Weekly report but in a more structured format.
To access and manage Timesheets:
- Go to the Timesheet page
- Use filters to select a specific employee and group the timesheet by Project
- You can export the timesheet as a PDF for easy printing or saving
Current work and tracked time #
You can monitor your team’s real-time activities and check for any discrepancies in tracked time through the Dashboard.
To view active timers:
- Navigate to the Team dashboard
- In the Last activity section, you’ll see the active timers of all employees
- You can also see who hasn’t tracked time for a specific date range by filtering the Total tracked column
This is a great way to quickly spot whether team members are meeting their weekly or monthly time goals.
Notify employees of time tracking issues #
Clockify offers automatic reminders for team members who are under or over their time targets.
Set reminders for employees:
- Set time tracking targets (e.g. 8 hours per day)
- If someone forgets to log their time, Clockify will send an email reminder
- If an employee exceeds their time target, you, as an Admin, will receive an email notification about the overage
Troubleshooting #
Sometimes, employees may report tracking time that doesn’t appear in your reports. This is typically caused by them tracking time in a different workspace (such as their personal workspace).
Make sure that employees are tracking their time in the correct workspace. When users create a Clockify account, they are given a personal workspace by default. If they’re working on a team project, they should track time in the workspace you’ve invited them to.
Export reports #
You can export all types of reports (Summary, Weekly, Detailed) in the following formats:
- Excel
- CSV
This is useful for sharing reports with your team, clients, or for archiving purposes.
Next steps: #
- Set up targets for time tracking and ensure your team is meeting them
- Export key reports and use pivot tables to customize your analysis
FAQ #
How can I view the hours tracked by a specific employee? #
To view the hours tracked by a specific employee, you can filter reports by user:
- Summary report: Use the user filter to select a specific employee, then group the data by Project, Task, or Date to see their hours.
- Detailed report: Apply the user filter to show only the time entries of the selected employee.
- Weekly report: Filter by User to display hours tracked by a specific person in the selected week.
Can I customize the reports to meet my specific needs? #
Yes! Clockify provides flexibility in customizing reports:
- Built-in grouping options: Use the Summary Report to group data by Project, User, Client, etc
- Export to CSV: For more advanced customization, you can export the Detailed report in CSV format and manipulate it using tools like Excel or Google Sheets to create pivot tables or apply custom filters
What should I do if I can’t find an employee’s tracked time in the report? #
If you can’t find time tracked by an employee, check if they are tracking time in the correct workspace. Clockify users may accidentally log time in their personal workspace instead of the workspace you’ve invited them to.
Can I change the date range in the Weekly report? #
The Weekly report is fixed to display data for one week at a time. If you need to analyze more than one week, use the Summary report. You can select any date range and group the data by User and Date to see the total hours tracked each day over a custom period.
Can I edit an employee’s time in the Detailed report? #
Yes, as an Admin, you can edit any employee’s time entries directly in the Detailed report. This feature allows you to correct mistakes or make adjustments to time entries if needed. To edit time, simply click on the entry and make the necessary changes.
How do I see if my employees are meeting their time targets? #
You can set time tracking targets (e.g. 8 hours per day) for your team. If employees don’t meet their target or exceed it, Clockify will send you email notifications. You can also track their progress in the Dashboard by viewing the Total tracked column to see who has or hasn’t met their targets.
What if I need to generate a report for a specific time period? #
Clockify lets you specify any date range for your reports:
- In the Summary report, you can set a custom date range by using the date picker at the top right corner
- In the Weekly report, you’ll need to select the specific week you want to review
For more detailed reporting over a longer period, the Summary report is your best option, as it allows greater flexibility in adjusting the date range.
Can I export time logs for a specific project or client? #
Yes, in the Summary report, you can group data by Project or Client and then export the results. You can select the date range and the relevant grouping options to get the time logs related to that specific project or client.
Can I track expenses in the reports? #
Yes, if your workspace is on the PRO plan or higher, you can track and report on expenses as well. The Detailed report allows you to see expenses alongside time entries. Admins and Team Managers can also manage and edit expenses in this report.
What happens to the approved time once it’s been withdrawn? #
Once approved time is withdrawn by an Admin:
- The time becomes editable again for further adjustments
- A permanent record of the withdrawn approval, including all time entries, is created in the Withdrawn tab for audit purposes
- Both the Admin and the employee will receive an email notification explaining why the approval was withdrawn
How do I make sure that data in my reports is accurate? #
To ensure your data is accurate:
- Regularly check Timesheets for any missing or incorrect entries
- Use Approvals to ensure time entries are verified by team managers
- Use the Detailed report to check for any discrepancies or manual adjustments to time entries
