Clockify notifications in Pumble app
Receive important notifications from Clockify directly in Pumble, our integrated business messaging platform. This helps your team stay informed and quickly take actions without leaving your communication tool.
How it works #
Clockify sends key notifications (like time tracking reminders, time off and approval updates) directly to your Pumble app workspace. This way, you can stay up-to-date with your team’s activities without having to check your email.
Get notifications #
If you have at least one active Clockify and one active Pumble workspace in the same CAKE.com organization, you’ll automatically start receiving notifications from Clockify in Pumble.
- Go to Profile settings in Clockify
- Open the menu
- Navigate to Preferences and choose Pumble notifications tab
- Click Try Pumble
If you don’t have a Pumble workspace, follow a guide and create one
If you already have a Pumble account (using the same email as in Clockify), you’ll be prompted to connect an existing Pumble app workspace or create a new one
One Pumble workspace can be connected to multiple Clockify workspaces. However, if you have multiple Pumble workspaces in your organization, you need to choose which one will be connected to Clockify.
Once connected:
- You’ll be notified in both Clockify and Pumble that the integration is live, with the link to manage your notification settings
- You’ll receive Clockify notifications in Pumble based on your preferences
Manage notifications #
All users can manage which notifications they receive in Pumble.
To manage notification settings in Clockify:
- Go to Preferences
- Choose Pumble notifications tab
- Choose the Pumble workspace where you want to receive notifications:
- If there is only one available, it will be selected by default
- If multiple are available, choose from the list
- If none are yet connected, you’ll see a Try Pumble button
- Customize which Clockify notifications you want to receive in Pumble:
Time tracking reminders (daily, weekly, monthly)
Time off updates (requests, balances)
Timesheet approvals (submitted, withdrawn, on behalf)
Managers and admins will also receive:
- Time tracking summaries for their teams
- Approval requests for submitted timesheets and time off requests
- Time off request updates
Managers and admins can approve, reject or withdraw requests submitted in Clockify directly from Pumble messages they receive.
Stop notifications #

or - Choose none as notification type
You can connect again or choose a different Pumble workspace to connect Clockify to.
