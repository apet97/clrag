Time off notification issues
If you are not receiving time off request notifications, it’s usually due to your notification preferences or your role in the approval process.
Time off email notifications are turned off in preferences #
Even if everything else is set up correctly, you won’t receive email notifications if you’ve disabled time off notifications in your own settings.
To check this:
- Click on your Profile picture in the top right corner and select “Preferences”
- Navigate to the “Email notifications” tab
- Make sure that the “Time off” checkbox is enabled
If this is turned off, no notifications will be sent, even if you’re listed as an approver.
You are not assigned as the approver in the policy #
You’ll only receive notifications if you’re listed as an approver in the Time Off policy settings.
To check:
- Navigate to the Time Off page from the sidebar
- Click on the cog icon and select “Manage Policies”
- Click on the three dots next to the Policy and select “Edit”
- Under “Who can approve” check if the approver is set to:
- An Admin
- A Team Manager
- A Specific Member added to the approver list
You are a Team Manager, but the requester is not under your management #
Being a Team Manager doesn’t guarantee that you’ll receive notifications. You’ll only be notified if the user requesting time off is part of your team.
To confirm:
- Navigate to the Team page from the sidebar
- Click on your role
- Check whether the user in question is listed under your management
Admins are not notified when Team Managers are the assigned approvers #
If the Time Off policy is set so that Team Managers can approve requests, then Admins will not receive notifications, even if they are Admins at the workspace level.
If you are an Admin and want to be notified:
- Assign yourself as a Team Manager to the users or teams you’re responsible for via the Team page
