How to view API calls in different programming languages in Postman
If you receive an API call from a user in a different programming language (e.g. Python, R, Swift, cURL), Postman can help you view the equivalent API call in a format thatâ€™s easier to work with.
Steps to convert API calls #
- Open Postman and click on the Code icon located in the right part of the screen
- From the side widget, choose the language you want (e.g. Python, Java, cURL)
- Postman will show the equivalent API endpoint in that language
- Or, paste the code:
- You can also paste the code from another language (e.g., Python, R, cURL) into Postman
- Postman will convert it to a format it can recognize and display the standard Postman view of the code
Postman will display the API call in the selected programming language, making it easier for you to check and troubleshoot.
