Manage subscription & billing for your workspace
As a Workspace Admin or Owner, managing your workspace’s subscription and billing settings is essential for accessing paid features and ensuring your team’s needs are met. In this guide, we’ll walk you through the process of managing subscriptions, upgrading or downgrading plans, and understanding billing cycles and user seats.
Key concepts #
Before diving into subscription management, it’s important to get familiar with some key concepts:
- User seats: Each active user in your workspace occupies a “seat.” You’re charged based on the number of active seats in your workspace, regardless of the user’s role or features
- Bundle seats: If you’re subscribed to the CAKE.com Productivity Suite, you may have additional bundle seats across different apps (Clockify, Pumble, Plaky)
- Full & limited users:
- Full users: Team members with complete access to the workspace
- Limited users: Team members with restricted access, mainly for clocking in and out. These users may be charged with some additional fees.
Billing & user seats #
Overview #
- You are charged for the total number of active user seats in your workspace, regardless of whether they are actively using the features
- If a user is deactivated, you can free up their seat and invite another user to take it
- You must buy a seat for each active user in your workspace
Manage user seats #
To ensure you have enough user seats available:
- If you run out of available seats, you can purchase more via the Subscription page
- Vacant seats can be removed, but once removed, they cannot be refunded
Only Workspace Owners and Admins can manage subscriptions, including adding and removing user seats.
Navigate Subscription page #
Your Subscription page is where you manage all billing-related settings, including your current plan, user seats, and payment information.
There are three key tabs:
- Billing:
- Tracks your current subscription plan, the number of used vs. available seats, and your billing information
- A progress bar shows how many seats are in use (blue for available, red for unavailable)
- Invoices:
- View all past invoices and billing statements for your workspace
- You can download invoices for future reference
- Plans:
- View available subscription plans and the option to upgrade or downgrade
Subscription billing intervals #
You can choose your preferred billing cycle:
- Annual billing: Pay once a year and get a discount on your total bill
- Monthly billing: Pay on a month-to-month basis
Switching between billing intervals #
You can switch between monthly and annual billing cycles at any time from the Subscription page:
- Annual to monthly: You’ll switch after the current year ends
- Monthly to annual: You’ll be charged a prorated price, adjusting for the time left on your current plan
Upgrade your subscription #
If you need more features or seats than your current plan offers, you can upgrade your subscription.
To upgrade:
- Go to the Subscription page
- Switch to the Plans tab
- Click Upgrade beneath the plan you want
- Select your billing period and confirm your upgrade
When you upgrade, you’ll be charged a prorated price for the new plan. Your user seat count will remain unchanged, but you’ll gain access to additional features.
Downgrade your subscription #
If you find you don’t need as many features, you can downgrade to a lower-tier plan.
To downgrade:
- Go to the Subscription page
- Switch to the Plans tab
- Click Downgrade below the plan you want
- Confirm the action
Downgrading removes access to any additional features from your higher-tier plan. You’ll retain your data, but your access to premium features will end when the current subscription period finishes.
Cancel or reactivate your subscription #
You can cancel your subscription at any time. If you later wish to return, you can reactivate it.
To cancel subscription:
- Go to the Billing tab
- Navigate to the right side of the screen and click Cancel subscription
- Confirm your decision
After canceling:
- No further charges will be made
- You can still download your past invoices
- You can continue using premium features until the end of your billing period
- After the paid period ends, your workspace will automatically switch to the Free plan
To reactivate your subscription, go back to the Subscription page and follow the prompts to restart your subscription.
Download invoices #
If you need a record of your billing history:
- Go to the Subscription page
- Switch to the Invoices tab
- Download any past invoices by selecting the appropriate statement
FAQ #
How is billing calculated? #
You are billed for the total number of active user seats in your workspace, regardless of the roles or features used. If a user is deactivated, their seat becomes available for another user.
Can I add more seats after upgrading my plan? #
Yes, you can always add more user seats through the Subscription page. When you add seats, you will be charged based on the prorated cost for the remaining billing period.
What happens if I downgrade my subscription? #
Downgrading removes access to any additional features you were using in the higher-tier plan, but your data will remain intact. You’ll lose access to premium features once the current subscription period ends.
Can I cancel my subscription? #
Yes, you can cancel your subscription at any time. After canceling, you can continue using premium features until the end of your billing period, after which you will be downgraded to the Free plan.
How do I switch between monthly and annual billing? #
You can switch from monthly to annual billing or vice versa from the Subscription page. Switching from annual to monthly will take effect at the end of your current subscription period. Switching from monthly to annual will be prorated based on the remaining time left on your current plan.
Can I get a refund for unused seats? #
No, Clockify does not provide refunds for removed user seats. You can only free up seats by deactivating users, and then you can add new users to occupy those seats.
Can I download past invoices? #
Yes, you can download all your past invoices from the Invoices tab on the Subscription page.
What’s the difference between full and limited users? #
Full users have access to all workspace features, while Limited users only have restricted access to clock in and out. Limited users may incur additional charges depending on your plan.
How do I upgrade my subscription? #
To upgrade, go to the Subscription page, switch to the Plans tab, and click Upgrade under the plan you want. You will be charged a prorated amount for the new plan.
