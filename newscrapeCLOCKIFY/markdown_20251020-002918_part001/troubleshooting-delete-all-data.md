How to delete all data
Clockify does not have a single “delete everything” button, but you can remove data from different sections manually or use an add-on for bulk deletion.
Here’s how to delete data depending on your plan and needs:
Delete time entries #
If you’re on a free plan:
- Navigate to the Detailed report
- Select the date range via the calendar
- Click on the three dots next to each time entry and delete
You’ll need to delete entries one by one.
If you are on a paid plan:
- Navigate to the Detailed report
- Select the date range via the calendar
- Click the checkbox at the top of the list next to the “time entry” text
- Click Delete to remove them in bulk
This will only delete time entries visible on the current page. Repeat if needed.
Delete projects #
Navigate to the Projects page from the sidebar
Free Plan
If you are on a free plan, you delete projects one by one:
- Click on the three dots next to the project
- Select Archive and then Delete
Paid Plan
If you are on a paid plan, you can delete projects in bulk:
- Click the checkbox next to the name column to select multiple projects
- Click Delete to remove them in bulk
Delete clients #
- Go to the Clients page
- Click on the three dots next to the client
- Select Archive, then Delete one by one
- If you’re on a paid plan
- Select all clients on the page using the checkbox
- Click Archive, then Delete to remove them in bulk
Delete all data #
If you want to wipe your workspace and start fresh, you can use the Clockify Clean add-on, available from the Clockify Marketplace.
To use Clockify Clean:
- Click the puzzle icon in the top right corner of the screen
- Find and install Clockify Clean
- Once installed, open the add-on
- Choose which data you’d like to delete
- Follow the prompts to bulk-delete data
Deletion of data in Clockify cannot be undone.
