Can I restrict API key access?
Currently, Clockify does not offer the ability to restrict API keys to read-only access for specific workspaces. The permissions available through the API are tied to the user’s role in the workspace.
Whatever actions a user can perform in the Clockify UI, they can also perform using their API key. This means there’s no way to create a key with limited permissions or restricted access to certain workspace data.
