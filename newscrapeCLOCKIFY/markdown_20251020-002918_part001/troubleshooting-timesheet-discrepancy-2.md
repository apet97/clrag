User timesheet discrepancy
If time entries in a user’s timesheet appear shifted, longer or shorter than expected, or don’t match what was originally tracked, the issue is most likely caused by time zone differences between the user and the person viewing the timesheet.
Clockify automatically adjusts time entries based on the local timezone of whoever is viewing them.
Time entries are shown in the viewer’s time zone #
Clockify displays time entries according to the time zone of the person viewing them, not the time zone in which they were tracked.
For example, if a user tracks time from 09:00 to 17:00 in UTC+1, and a manager in UTC-5 views the entry, it may appear as 3:00 to 11:00, even though the duration is still accurate.
Check the exact start and end times in Detailed report #
If the user is in a different time zone, the times shown will still be adjusted to the viewer’s time zone by default.
To match the user’s time zone:
- Click on your profile icon in the upper right corner
- Select “Preferences”
- Under the time zone, switch to the user’s time zone
This will show the time entry exactly as it was tracked.
To see the original tracked start and end time:
- Go to the Detailed report page
- Locate the time entry in question
Duration remains accurate #
Even if start and end times appear shifted, the total duration of the time entry is always correct, regardless of time zone.
This applies whether the time was tracked:
- Manually, or
- Using the timer feature
