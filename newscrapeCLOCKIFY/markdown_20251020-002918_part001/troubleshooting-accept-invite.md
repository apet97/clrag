How do I accept the invite?
If you’ve been invited to join a workspace, here’s how to accept it:
- Log in to your mailbox
- Click on the email with the subject ‘workspace invitation’
- Open the mail and click on the ‘accept invite’ button
If you already have a Clockify account, you can accept the invite via the notification:
- Log in to your Clockify account
- Click on the bell icon located in the upper-right corner of the screen
- Click the ‘accept invite’ button
By completing either of the steps above, you’ll automatically be redirected to the workspace where you can start tracking your time.
