Navigate your dashboard
Dashboard provides important insights into your time usage, allowing you to see how your time is distributed across different activities, projects, and billable hours. This guide will help you get familiar with the layout and functionality of the Dashboard in Clockify, so you can easily track your time, monitor your activities, and boost your productivity.
Dashboard view #
Personal dashboard (Only me)
This view shows the time you’ve tracked and allows you to analyze your personal time usage. You can view your billable vs. non-billable time or get a breakdown of time spent on each project.
Team dashboard
This view provides a breakdown of your team’s tracked time. It shows the total tracked time for each team member, what they’re currently working on, and a detailed breakdown by project or billability. You can also view the most recent activity for each team member.
Switch views #
At the top right corner of the dashboard, you can toggle between your Personal dashboard (Only me) and the Team dashboard. You can easily switch to the Team Dashboard by clicking on Only me/Team at the top right of the page.
