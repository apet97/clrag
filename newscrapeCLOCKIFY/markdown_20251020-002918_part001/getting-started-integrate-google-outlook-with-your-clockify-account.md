Integrate Google/Outlook with your Clockify account
Clockify allows you to integrate your Google calendar or Outlook calendar (Office 365) with your account, so you can view your calendar events directly within Clockify.
Benefits of the integration:
- Side-by-side view: Compare your calendar’s planned events with the actual time you’ve tracked
- Create time entries: Create time entries based on calendar events and track time for your scheduled activities
- View calendar events: See all your scheduled events in a new column within Clockify.
Important to note: #
- Only events with start and end times will appear in Clockify, all-day events will not be displayed
- Any changes made in your external calendar will automatically reflect in Clockify
- Clockify has view-only access to your calendar. This means it can only read events but cannot edit them.
- The integration is available for Google Calendar and cloud-based Outlook (Office 365). On-premise and hybrid versions of Outlook are not supported.

- Create a time entry from the event: You can create a time entry in Clockify based on the event details, making time tracking effortless.
- Open the event in your external calendar: You can open the event directly in Google Calendar or Outlook for more details.
