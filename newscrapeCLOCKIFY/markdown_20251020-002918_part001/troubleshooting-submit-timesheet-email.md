Submit timesheet email not received
If you’re expecting a submit timesheet email notification and it’s not showing up, there may be a few settings or role assignments preventing it from being delivered. Here’s how to check what might be causing the issue and how to resolve it.
Approval role is not assigned correctly #
Even if you’re an admin, you won’t receive email notifications unless you’re explicitly assigned a Project Manager or Team Manager role, depending on the approval settings in your workspace.
What to do:
- Navigate to the Team page from the sidebar
- Click on your role title under the “Role” column
- Assign yourself a Team Manager or Project Manager, depending on who is set to approve timesheets in your workspace
Admins can verify the current approval settings by following the steps below:
- Click on the three dots next to your workspace name
- Select “Workspace settings.”
- Navigate to the “Permissions” tab
- Check who is allowed to approve timesheets (Admins and PMs / Admins and TMs)
Team Managers and Project Managers will only receive email notifications if the workspace settings allow it. If your workspace is set to allow only Admins and Project Managers to approve timesheets, Team Managers won’t receive any notifications.
Email notifications for timesheet approvals are disabled #
If the correct role is assigned but no emails are received, it’s possible that timesheet email notifications are turned off in profile preferences.
To verify:
- Click on your profile picture in the upper right corner and select “Preferences”
- Navigate to the Email Notifications tab
- Ensure the Approval option is enabled
Timesheet has not been submitted #
Email notifications for timesheet approvals are only triggered when the timesheet is submitted.
To confirm:
- Navigate to the Approvals page from the sidebar
- Check the “Unsubmitted” and “Pending” tabs
- Look for the timesheet in question
- Check with the user whether the Submit button was clicked
