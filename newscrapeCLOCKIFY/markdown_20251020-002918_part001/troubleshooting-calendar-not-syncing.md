Calendar events from Google or Outlook not syncing
If your Google or Outlook events aren’t appearing in the Clockify Calendar, the issue is most likely related to the calendar connection or browser.
The wrong calendar might be connected #
Make sure the calendar you expect to see events from is actually listed and enabled.
- Navigate to the Calendar page
- Click on the cog icon in the upper right corner
- Under Google or Outlook, check which calendar accounts are connected
Reconnect the calendar #
If the correct calendar is connected, but events still aren’t showing:
- Click on the three dots next to the connected calendar (Google or Outlook)
- Select Disconnect
- Reconnect the calendar by following the prompts
- Go back to the calendar and check if events appear
Browser issues might be preventing the sync #
If reconnecting doesn’t work, try the following:
- Clear cache and cookies
- Open Clockify in an incognito or private window
- Try using a different browser to see if the issue persists
