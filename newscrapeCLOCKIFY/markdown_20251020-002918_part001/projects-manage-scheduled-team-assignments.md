Track cost and billability per user #
Team tab allows you to track costs and billable amounts per user alongside scheduled projects and tasks.
To view cost amounts and billability for a project or task, make sure both cost rate and billable hours are enabled in the Workspace settings. If either is disabled, you won’t see this information on the Scheduling page.
To enable billabile hours on a workspace:
- Open Workspace settings
- Switch to the Permissions tab
- In the Billable hours section, enable Activate billable hours
To enable cost rate on a workspace:
- Open Workspace settings
- In the General tab, Cost and profit analysis section, enable Activate cost rate
Additionally, a Workspace cost rate field will appear, allowing you to set the default cost rate for each tracked hour in your workspace.
Optionally, set additional permissions regarding who can view hourly rates, amounts, and the billable status of entries.
To enable cost rate and billability on Schedule page:
- Open Workspace settings
- In the General tab, under the Scheduling section, enable See billable cost and amount
To see total billable and cost amount per user:
- Check the Amount/Cost column for totals
- Expand users to see more details on scheduled projects/tasks
Collapsed view
- Assigned hours: Total hours assigned to each user
- Amount/Cost: Total cost data for each user, similar to the Projects tab
Expanded view
When expanded, the Amount/Cost column shows financial data for each project. If a user has multiple projects in different currencies, the default currency is shown first, followed by others in alphabetical order. Hovering over the notation reveals all amounts.
Daily and weekly capacity #
Use the Daily capacity option to see if users are under, over, or at full capacity for that day. Hovering shows Amount and Cost rates. This applies to the Weekly view as well, just on a weekly level.
Amount and cost values are displayed in the number and currency format set up in the Workspace settings.
If you downgrade your subscription plan or disable billability, Amount and Cost data won’t appear the timeline.
Performance tracking #
To keep track of performance, use Assignments report to compare assigned vs actual working hours.
