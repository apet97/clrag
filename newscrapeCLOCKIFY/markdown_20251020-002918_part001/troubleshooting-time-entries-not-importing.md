Time entries aren’t importing into invoices
If your time entries aren’t showing up when creating an invoice, here’s how to fix it.
The time entries aren’t assigned to a project or a client #
Invoices in Clockify are based on clients, and time entries must be connected to a project that belongs to a client. If you tracked time without assigning it to a project, or the project isn’t assigned to a client, the time won’t show up when importing invoices.
How to assign time entries to a project using Bulk Edit:
- Navigate to the Detailed report
- Select the relevant date range from the calendar
- Click the checkbox next to “time entry”
- Click “Bulk Edit”
- Check the project option and select the correct project from the drop-down menu
- Click Save
How to assign a project to a client:
- Navigate to the Projects page from the sidebar
- Click on the project to open it
- Navigate to the Settings tab
- Under Client, choose a client from the dropdown or create a new one
The wrong project is selected when creating an invoice #
Only time entries from the selected projects for the chosen client will be pulled into the invoice.
How to compare invoice selection with the Detailed report:
- Open the Detailed report and filter by the desired time period
- Look at the Project and Client section for the relevant time entries
Or:
- Open the Detailed report and select a date range from the calendar
- Filter a report by using Client and Project filters
- Apply filter
- Go to the invoices and click on “Create new invoice”
- Make sure you’ve selected the same client show in the report
- In the Projects dropdown, confirm same projects from the report are selected
If the client or project isn’t selected in the invoice, the time won’t be imported.
The date range is incorrect
Clockify defaults to last month when importing time entries into an invoice. If your entries are from this month or a different period, they won’t show.
How to compare the date range with the Detailed report:
- Open the Detailed report and set the date range you want to invoice
- Confirm which days the time entries fall on
- Go to the invoice and click “Import time and expenses”
- Change the date range to match the one you used in the Detailed report
Make sure the date range in the invoice fully covers the dates from the report. Even a one-day gap can cause entries to be excluded.
The time entries have already been invoiced #
Clockify only allows each time entry to be invoiced once. If the time you’re trying to import has already been used in another invoice, it won’t show up again.
How to check the Detailed report:
- Go to Detailed report
- Select a relevant date range from the calendar
- Click on the Status filter and select “invoiced”
- Apply a filter, and look for the “invoiced” tag next to a time entry
How to see which invoice it was imported to:
- Hover over the invoice tag on an entry, and you’ll see the name of the invoice that entry was added to
- You can locate that invoice from the Invoices page
If that invoice is no longer needed:
- You can delete it to free up those entries for reuse.
- Or, if you’re ready to send it, go ahead and finalize it by clicking “Send invoice”.
