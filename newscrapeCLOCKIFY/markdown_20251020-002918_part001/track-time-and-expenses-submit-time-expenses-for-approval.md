Submit time & expenses for approval
Users can submit their weekly, monthly and semi-monthly timesheets and expenses for approval. As an Admin/Team manager, you need to review these submissions to verify billable hours and project expenses before approving them for client invoicing.
Time
Time approval is a paid feature, which you can enable by upgrading your workspace to Standard, Pro, or Enterprise plan.
Expenses
To submit expenses for approval, you need to activate Expense tracking in the workspace settings. This way, when you submit tracked time for the approval, tracked expenses will also be submitted for that time period and vice versa.
Expense approval is a paid feature which you can enable by upgrading to Pro or Enterprise plan.
For more information on the approval process, check out Approve time & expenses.
