Where to generate API key for account
To generate an API key for your Clockify account, follow these steps:
- Go to your account menu in the top right corner
- Select Preferences
- In the Preferences menu, click on the Advanced tab
- In the API Key section, click on Generate to create a new API key
- Copy and store the key
After the key is generated, immediately copy the API key and store it somewhere secure. Once you close the window, the key will no longer be visible
Ensure that the API key is stored securely, as it cannot be viewed again after the window is closed.
