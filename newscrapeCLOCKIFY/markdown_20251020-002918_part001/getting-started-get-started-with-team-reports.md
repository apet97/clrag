Clockify provides various reports that allow you to view your employees’ time entries in different ways, from summarized overviews to detailed breakdowns.

Types of reports #
Summary report #
The Summary report is highly flexible and allows you to group your team’s time entries in various ways to match your reporting needs.
You can group data by:
- Project
- Client
- User
- Group
- Tag
- Month
- Week
- Date
How to use:
- Common scenario: To get an overview of your team’s hours by user and project, select User as the main grouping and Project as a subgroup. You can further subgroup by Task if needed. This will give you a detailed breakdown of the time tracked by each team member for specific tasks within projects.
- By date: Another useful way to view hours is by grouping by Date, which will show you the total hours each employee tracked per day. This is ideal if you need to see a bi-weekly or monthly report for your team, and the Weekly report doesn’t suit your needs.
- Three levels of grouping: The Summary report supports up to three levels of grouping, providing a more granular view of your data. You can customize the date range to meet your specific reporting needs.
Weekly report #
The Weekly report is designed for weekly tracking of hours worked. You can group the data by User or Project.
How to use:
- Set date range: This report shows data for a fixed weekly range (one week at a time). You cannot change the date range to show more than one week, but the Summary Report can be used to view multiple weeks or any custom date range.
- Perfect for weekly overviews: If you’re monitoring your team’s work on a week-to-week basis, this is a great report for that.
Detailed report #
The Detailed report provides a comprehensive breakdown of time entries, showing each entry individually without any grouping or summarization.
How to use:
- Use this report to see all the details of your team’s time entries. An Admin can also edit entries in this report.
- The Detailed Report can be exported in CSV, allowing you to create custom reports or further process the data in tools like Excel or Google Sheets.
Filter reports by individual employees #
If you need data for a single employee, you can use filters to narrow the report to only show that employee’s hours.
Steps to filter:
- Go to the Report page (Summary, Detailed, or Weekly)
- Apply filters: Use the filter options to select the specific employee or group of employees
- View data: The report will now only show the time entries for the selected employee(s)
Customize reports #
If the built-in Clockify reports don’t meet your exact needs, you can customize your reports by exporting the Detailed Report as CSV and using tools like Excel or Google Sheets to create your own custom reports.
In Excel or Google Sheets, you can create pivot tables to rearrange the data into the structure you need.
This flexibility allows you to adjust reports to fit different team structures or project needs.
Timesheet view #
If you’re on a paid subscription plan, you can also access employee Timesheets directly, which is similar to the Weekly report but with more customization options.
- Filter timesheets by a specific employee and group by Project for detailed tracking of time
- Export timesheets to PDF or Excel for record-keeping or reporting
To export use your browser’s Print option (Ctrl/Cmd + P) to Save as PDF if you need to save a copy of the Timesheet.
Monitoring active work and tracked time #
You can keep track of the current work being done by your team members through the Team dashboard.
Steps to monitor active work:
- Go to the Team dashboard
- View last activity with all active timers
- You can filter reports by date range to see who has not tracked time in a given period Sort the Total tracked column in ascending order to identify users with no time tracked.
- Use the dashboard to track whether your team has met their weekly/monthly hours quota
To see users who haven’t tracked time:
In the Weekly report, group by User and click Show users without time.
This can be especially helpful for managers who need to monitor adherence to time tracking requirements.
Notifications for below or above target #
Clockify allows you to set targets for your team’s daily or weekly hours, and you can receive email reminders if someone:
- Forgets to log their time (Clockify sends reminders to fill timesheets)
- Exceeds their target (Managers are notified if tracked time is above the set target)
Troubleshooting: Tracked time not visible in reports #
If a team member claims they’ve tracked time, but you can’t find it in the reports, it could be because they tracked time in a different workspace.
What to do:
- Make sure the team member is tracking time in the correct workspace (especially if they’ve created a personal workspace during sign-up).
- If they mistakenly tracked time in their personal workspace, you will need to check that workspace as well.
