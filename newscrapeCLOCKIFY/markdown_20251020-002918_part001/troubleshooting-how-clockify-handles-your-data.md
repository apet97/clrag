How Clockify handles your data
Clockify takes data security seriously and gives users full control over how their data is stored, accessed, and exported. Here’s how data is handled and how you can create your own backups when needed.
Is my data safe in Clockify? #
Clockify data is securely hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and protected both physically and electronically. All connections between you and Clockify are encrypted using 256-bit SSL encryption, the same standard used in online banking.
While we perform regular infrastructure-level backups, Clockify does not offer per-account recovery in cases where data is accidentally deleted or overwritten by users. For this reason, it’s highly recommended to create personal backups of your data on a regular basis.
You can read more about security measures here.
What data does Clockify collect? #
Clockify only stores data you actively provide or consent to:
- Cookies are used for login sessions
- Google Analytics tracks which website pages are visited (anonymized)
- Manual input is required for time tracking. Clockify does not log data automatically unless you enable it
- Idle detection and auto-tracker are optional features; data from these remains private and is only visible to the user
- Screenshots and location tracking are only collected if explicitly enabled by an admin. All users are notified when these features are activated
- Location tracking applies to the mobile app (if permissions are granted)
- Screenshots are collected via the desktop app (if installed and running)
At any time, you can delete your account and all associated data. For more details, refer to our Privacy Policy.
Export your data for personal backup #
You can export all your time-tracking data at any time using the Detailed Report:
- Go to the reports page and select Detailed report
- Set the longest possible date range from the calendar
- Export to CSV
This export contains all relevant time entry data and can serve as a personal archive or recovery point.
Creating periodic exports gives you full control of your records and acts as a safeguard against accidental deletions or workspace resets.
