PIN
You can require your employees to enter a personal 4-digit PIN to clock in via a kiosk.
PIN is a paid feature, that you can enable by upgrading your account to any paid plan.
Enabling PIN #
When you create or edit a kiosk, you should enable the Requires PIN checkbox. If you don’t, everyone can select any employee’s profile and clock in for them.
Universal PIN
Each kiosk has a Universal PIN that allows you to clock in and out for any employee (except owner/admin)
e.g. Give this PIN to a shift manager so that can clock in for a team if needed.
Entering PIN #
Each person automatically gets their own personal PIN code.
To clock in, an employee simply selects their profile on the kiosk and enters their personal PIN.
If you know kiosk’s Universal PIN, you can enter it instead of a personal PIN to clock in for any employee.
A Universal PIN cannot be used to sign in with owner/admin role. They must always use their personal PIN code.
