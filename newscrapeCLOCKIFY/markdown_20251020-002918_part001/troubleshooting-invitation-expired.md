Invitation link expired
If you get the message that the invitation link has expired when you try to accept it, here are the steps you can take.
Make sure that you haven’t already accepted the invitation and created an account #
If you’ve accepted the invitation via the link already, it will automatically become invalid, and you won’t be able to log into your workspace via it.
To check this:
- Navigate to the clockify.me
- Enter your credentials (email and verification code)
- Log in
If you already have an account, you can accept the pending invite via the notification center, which is located under the bell icon.
The invite expired #
Invitation links expire after 14 days, so if you haven’t accepted one during that time, the account admin will need to provide you with a new one.
Steps for the admins of the account #
Here’s how you can resend the invite:
- Navigate to the team page
- Click on the three dots next to the user who has the ‘not joined yet’ tag
- Select the ‘send an invite email’ option
Alternatively, you can remove the user completely from your account and add them again by following these steps:
- Click on your profile icon and select “Manage CAKE.com account”
- In the next window, navigate to the “Members” section
- Find the user that you’d like to remove and click to expand the details
- Click on the three dots in the upper right corner and select “Delete”
- Go back to the team page and add them again by clicking on the “Add full member” button
Only the account owners have permissions to delete team members who haven’t accepted the invite yet.
