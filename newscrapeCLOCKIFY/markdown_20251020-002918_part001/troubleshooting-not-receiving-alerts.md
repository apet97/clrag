Not receiving project estimate alerts
If you’ve set up a time or budget estimate on a project or a task but aren’t receiving alerts when the threshold is crossed, here’s how to troubleshoot the issue and ensure alerts are properly delivered.
Alerts are not sent immediately #
Estimate alerts are sent approximately 30 minutes after the threshold is reached, meaning that if your estimate is set to trigger at 80%, an alert won’t appear instantly. It will typically be delivered via email within 30-40 minutes.
Alerts are only sent once per threshold #
Clockify sends a single alert when the estimate threshold is reached, for example, 80% or 100%. If your tracked time jumps rapidly past multiple thresholds, you’ll only receive the alert for the highest one reached, not for the lower thresholds passed.
Workspace alert rules may be misconfigured #
Admins define who receives alerts and when they are sent. If no alert rules exist or the wrong group is selected, notifications won’t go out.
How to check (Admins):
- Click on the three dots next to the Workspace name
- Select “Workspace settings”
- Navigate to the Alerts tab
- Review the rules and confirm which group is selected:
- Admins
- Project Managers
- Project Members
You can define multiple rules that include all groups by clicking on the “Add” button.
Your role doesn’t match the alert rule #
Even if you are a part of the workspace, you won’t receive alerts unless your role matches the selected rule.
Examples:
- If the rule says Project managers, you must be assigned as a project manager on that project.
- If the rule says Project members, you must be added to the project access list.
How to verify:
- For Project Managers:
- Navigate to the Projects page from the sidebar
- Check the list of projects for that specific project
Clockify only shows you the projects you are officially assigned to manage.
- For regular users (verified by Admins or Project Managers)
- Navigate to the Projects page from the sidebar
- Click on the project to open it
- Go to the Access tab
- Check if the team member in question is listed under the “Members” section
Your personal email preferences may be disabled #
Even if the alert rules are correct, you won’t receive alerts if you’ve disabled them in your email preferences.
- Click on your profile picture located in the upper-right corner and select “Preferences”
- Navigate to the “Email Preferences” tab
- Make sure “Alerts” option is selected
