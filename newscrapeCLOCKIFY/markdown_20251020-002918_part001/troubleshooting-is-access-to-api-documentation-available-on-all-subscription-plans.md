Is access to API documentation available on all subscription plans?
1 min read
Yes, the Clockify API documentation is available to all users, regardless of their subscription plan. However, there are certain limitations based on the permissions tied to your API key:
- Free plans: You will be able to access the API but may be restricted from using certain paid features (e.g. inviting users, creating projects, managing specific features)
- Paid plans: Full access to all features will be available through the API, depending on your workspace permissions
