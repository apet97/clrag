Changing team member’s personal information
In compliance with GDPR, personal information such as name and email address can only be updated by the user. Admins and workspace owners cannot modify this information on behalf of other team members.
However, team members can update their personal information at any time by following the steps below:
- Click on your profile picture in the upper right corner
- Select “Manage CAKE.com account”
- Click on “Edit” next to the email and name fields
- Make the changes and save
As an admin, you can still manage
- Week start day
- Working days
- Daily work capacity
- Custom user fields (internal tracking, departments, roles, etc.)
These settings can be adjusted from the Team page by clicking the three dots next to a user and selecting Edit profile.
