Customize user info exports
Customizing the user info export file allows you to tailor user info export to your specific needs and get the precise information for analysis, integration with other tools, or compliance purposes.
This is a paid feature you can enable by upgrading your workspace to any of the paid plans.
To configure export settings:
- Go to the Team page
- Choose info you’d like to export (Full/Limited tab)
- Expand the Export dropdown menu at the top right corner of the page
- Click Customize to choose information you’d like to export
- Click Save
Each user info export will contain only the data you selected.
For more information, check out Export user info.
The type of info you can export and customize depends on type of users (Full/Limited) and your subscription plan (Free/Basic/Standard/Pro/Enterprise).
Full user #
Full tab contains a list and information about full members in your workspace.
Free plan #
If the user is on a Free plan, the download file contains:
- Name: User’s name
- Email: User’s email
- Billable rate (user’s billable rate expressed in set currency)

Users on Pro and Enterprise plan have the same columns as those on a Standard plan.

If you have active user custom fields, they will also appear in the download file. Custom field type switch is exported as Yes if enabled and No if disabled.
Limited user #
If the Kiosk feature is enabled in your workspace and you have users that only use Kiosk to clock in & out, then you also have a Limited tab with a list and information related to those users.

Pro & Enterprise plans #
Cost rate refers to the user’s cost rate. When Cost rate is activated in the settings, the corresponding column is available in the info export.
Also, if you have any active user custom fields, they will also be available in the file. Custom field type switch will be exported as Yes if enabled, and No if disabled.
When you click on Save, the changes are saved and all the settings (checked parameters) are saved on a user level until you change it again, manually.
If you downgrade to a Free plan, or the Free trial expires the export customization options will be restored to the default again.
