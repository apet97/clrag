Required fields
You can prevent users from adding incomplete time entries by using required fields. This will ensure that all time entries have a mandatory minimum amount of information assigned to them, so your reports are organized and accurate at all times.
Required fields is a paid feature, which you can enable by upgrading your workspace to any of the paid plans.
How to enable required fields #
On the Workspace Settings page, administrators can define which fields on a time entry are mandatory before the time entry can be created.
You can make these fields mandatory:
- Project
- Task
- Tag
- Description
When the task is a required field, projects that don’t have tasks don’t show up in the project picker.
How it works #
For example, if you check project and tags as required:
- No one can add a time entry without a project and tag (not even admins)
- The timer can be started but can’t be stopped until you add a project and tag
- Timesheet won’t let you add time without selecting a tag
