Holiday entry not created
If a holiday time entry isn’t appearing in your reports, it’s usually due to one of the following reasons.
Time entries are not set to be created automatically #
If this option in the holiday settings is disabled, you won’t see any time entries for that date.
To check that:
- Go to the Time Off page
- Click on the “Cog” icon and select “Manage Holidays”.
- Click on the three dots next to the Holiday policy in question
- Check if the “Automatically create time entries” option is enabled
The Holiday is not assigned to the team member #
If a team member does not see the entry, or you do not see them in the reports, they may not be included in the holiday policy.
- Go to the Time Off page
- Click on the “Cog” icon and select “Manage Holidays”
- Click on the three dots next to the Holiday policy in question
- Check if the team member has been assigned to the policy under the “Assignees” menu
Holiday entries are created on the date of the holiday, not in advance or retroactively. If you’re checking before or after the holiday has passed, the entry won’t appear unless the holiday was set up properly ahead of time.
