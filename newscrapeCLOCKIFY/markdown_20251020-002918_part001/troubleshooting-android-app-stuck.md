Android app stuck on login screen
If the Clockify Android app gets stuck loading the login page indefinitely, here’s how to fix it.
Force close the app #
- Open your phone’s Settings
- Go to Apps or Applications
- Find and tap Clockify
- Tap Force Stop
This will fully shut down the app so it can restart.
Check default browser settings #
Clockify uses your default browser to load the login page, so if a non-standard or incompatible browser is set, it may cause issues.
- Go to Settings -> Apps -> Default apps
- Tap Browser app
- Select Chrome or Firefox as your default browser
If you do not have those browsers installed, download them from the Play Store.
Reinstall the Clockify app #
- Go to your phone’s Settings -> Apps
- Find and tap Clockify
- Tap Uninstall
- Open the Google Play Store
- Search for Clockify and reinstall the app
- Open the app and try logging in again
