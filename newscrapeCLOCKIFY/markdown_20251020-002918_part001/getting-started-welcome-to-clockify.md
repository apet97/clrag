Welcome to Clockify
Clockify is the only free time tracking software on the market. It’s so simple that you and your team can track work time with one click.
Navigation menu #
Clockify is an integral part of the CAKE.com Productivity Suite. When you navigate the menu, you’ll encounter all three products within the Suite: Clockify, Pumble, and Plaky. If you expand the Clockify label, you’ll see a list of all the workspaces you joined.
If you click on either Pumble or Plaky, you’ll be redirected to dedicated marketing pages, providing you insights into the respective products.
Time tracker #
Everything in Clockify revolves around time entries. You track time you spend working on things and then analyze workweeks in reports. Clockify also lets you invite others, so you can track and analyze time together.
There are several ways you can create time entries in Clockify:
- Using timer, as you work
When you start working, type what you’re working on and start a timer. When you finish, stop the timer and the time entry gets added automatically to your timesheet. - Add time manually, after you’ve finished
If you don’t want to bother with the timer (or you forgot to start it), you can manually add time entries after the fact. Simply type what you worked on, choose start and/or duration, and add the time entry. You can also create entries via Calendar. - Add via auto tracker
If you need precision but forget to start and stop the timer, enable the auto tracker. Then, at the end of the day, go through all the recorded activities (e.g. apps and websites you used) and create time entries from them.
