Roles #
Admins & owners #
Admins and owners have the highest level of access and control within Clockify. They are responsible for managing workspace settings, user permissions, and overall workspace administration.
Owners hold the highest level of authority in the Clockify app. As the individuals who created the workspace, they possess unparalleled control over workspace management. Owners have all the privileges of admins but also possess exclusive rights such as the ability to set up Single Sign-On (SSO). Additionally, owners are the only ones who can initiate the deletion of the entire workspace, which occurs if they leave or delete their account.
Admins have significant control and authority within the Clockify app. They are responsible for managing workspace settings, user permissions, and overall workspace administration. Admins can perform actions such as creating and managing projects, assigning user roles, and defining billable rates.
Managers #
There are two types of managers in Clockify:
- Project Managers
- Team Managers
Manager role is a paid feature, which you can enable by upgrading your workspace to Standard, Pro, or Enterprise plan.
Project Managers can view tracked time on their projects, manage project details, launch Kiosk if enabled and approve submitted timesheets.
