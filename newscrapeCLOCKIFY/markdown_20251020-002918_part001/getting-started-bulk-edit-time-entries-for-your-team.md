Bulk edit time entries for your team
One of the responsibilities of a Manager is to make sure that there is accurate and up-to-date time tracking for your team. If you manage a large volume of time entries, the Bulk edit feature will help you improve this process. Here’s how to make the most of this feature.
What is bulk edit? #
Bulk edit allows you to update multiple time entries at once. Whether you’re adjusting tags, changing project details, or marking time entries as favorites, Bulk edit can save you time and ensure consistency across your team’s time tracking.
Access permissions for bulk edit #
As a Team manager or Project manager, you have permission to bulk edit and bulk delete time entries. However, please note that Admins have the highest level of access and can configure workspace settings like required fields and general permissions. You’ll have full control over your team’s time entries but may need to coordinate with an Admin for certain settings.
How to bulk edit time entries #
You can bulk edit time entries directly from the Time tracker page:
- Go to the Time tracker page where your team’s daily time entries are recorded
- Find the edit icon next to the total number of hours tracked for a specific day
- Click the edit icon, and bulk edit will be enabled for that day’s time entries
Once bulk edit is active, you can modify multiple time entries for that day at once.
Update multiple time entries in the Detailed report #
To update time entries across a larger time range, follow these steps:
- Go to the Detailed report
- Use the checkboxes to select the time entries you want to edit
You can also use filters to narrow down which time entries you want to modify (e.g. by project, user, or date) - After selecting the entries, click the Bulk edit button at the top of the table
- You’ll be able to modify several fields, including:
- Tags
- Projects
- Tasks
- Description
For each field you want to update, choose the new values. For example: Change the tags or assign the selected entries to a new project.
Once you’re done, click Save to apply the updates to all selected time entries.
Add tags to time entries #
When updating time entries in bulk, you have two options for handling tags:
- Existing tags will be replaced with the new tag you select
- If you want to add a new tag without replacing the old one, check the Add to existing option. This will allow multiple tags to be assigned to the same time entry.
Mark time entries as favorites #
This feature is available with paid plans.
For easier access to frequently used time entries, you can mark them as favorites:
- Use the checkboxes to select the time entries you want to mark as favorites
- Choose the option to mark those entries as favorites
- Save
This allows you to quickly access and track commonly used time entries in the Time tracker.

Move time entries between workspaces #
This is a paid feature and requires the workspace to be upgraded.
If you need to transfer time entries from one workspace to another, you can do so using the Import timesheet feature:
- In the Detailed report, choose the date range and any necessary filters, then export the report as a CSV file
- Log into the destination workspace where you want to move the time entries
- Go to Settings > Import and upload the CSV file
- Follow the prompts to start the import process
Delete time entries #
If you need to remove a time entry, follow these steps:
- Select time entry
- Click the three dots on the right side of the time entry you want to delete
- Confirm by clicking Delete
If you accidentally delete a time entry, you can undo the action by following the steps below.
Undo a deleted time entry #
If you are working in bulk and accidentally delete the wrong entry, you will be able to restore it with the Undo option.
If you delete a time entry by mistake, you can easily undo the action:
- After you confirm the deletion, a toast notification will appear at the bottom of the screen with an Undo button
- You have 10 seconds to undo the deletion
After you click Undo, the entry will be restored, including all data (e.g. project, tags, time spent).
Best practices #
- When working with a large number of entries, it’s helpful to filter your data by project, user, or date before selecting entries to edit. This ensures you only update the time entries you need to change.
- Bulk edits cannot be undone unless you use the Undo feature immediately. Always double-check the values you’re updating before saving to avoid mistakes.
- If you frequently use tags for categorizing time, ensure they’re consistently applied across your workspace.
