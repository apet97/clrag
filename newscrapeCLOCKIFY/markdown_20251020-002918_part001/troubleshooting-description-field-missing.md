Description field missing in the Timesheet
In the Timesheet view, you won’t see the description field by default. This view is designed for fast time input across the week.
But you can still add a description (and more details) after creating an entry. Here’s how:
Add your time normally
- Select a project and a task
- Enter your hours directly into the timesheet cells
Click on the three dots in the cell
- Once the entry is created, click on the three dots in the cell
- A detailed pop-up will open
Add your description and other details
In the pop-up window, you can:
- Add a description
- Set start and end times
- Add tags
- Add other time entry details
Descriptions are linked to individual time entries. If you enter the same project across multiple rows, you’ll need to add a description to each entry separately if needed. If you prefer to add a description while creating the entry, use the Time Tracker page instead.
