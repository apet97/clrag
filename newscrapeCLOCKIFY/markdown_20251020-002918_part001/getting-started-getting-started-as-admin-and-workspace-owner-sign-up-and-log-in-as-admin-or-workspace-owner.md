Troubleshooting #
If you encounter any issues while logging in, here are a few things to keep in mind:
If, during the login process, you mistakenly entered a new email address that is not linked to an existing Clockify account, you will be redirected to the signup screen. You can then complete the signup process and create a new Clockify account with that email address.
Failed login attempts #
- If you enter the wrong login details 5 times in a row, your account will be locked for 24 hours to prevent unauthorized access.
- You will receive an email notifying you of the lockout. You can manually unlock your account before the 24-hour period is over to continue with the login process.
Single sign-on (SSO) login #
If you want to avoid entering your login credentials each time, you can set up Single Sign-On (SSO) to connect Clockify with your organization’s identity provider. This allows you to sign in automatically without needing to enter your credentials manually.
This feature is available on the Enterprise subscription plan.
Set up SSO #
- You can configure SSO by linking the Clockify subdomain to an identity provider (like Google Workspace, Okta, etc.).
- Once SSO is configured, users can sign in to Clockify using their organization’s SSO credentials.
FAQ #
Can I sign up using my Google account? #
Yes, you can sign up with your Google account:
- Click on Continue with Google on the signup page
- Choose the Google email you want to associate with your Clockify account
- You’ll be automatically redirected to your newly created workspace
What happens if I enter the wrong email or password during login? #
If you fail to log in with the correct credentials 5 times in a row, your account will be locked for 24 hours. You’ll receive an email with instructions to manually unlock your account before the 24-hour lock expires.
What is a verification code and how long is it valid? #
A verification code is a 6-character code (numbers and letters) sent to your email when you sign up or log in. The code is valid for 30 seconds and needs to be entered promptly to complete the verification process.
What if I forget my email or can’t find my verification email? #
If you can’t find the verification email, make sure to check your spam or junk folder. If you still can’t find it, request a new verification email by clicking the Resend verification link.
Can I log in using single sign-on (SSO)? #
Yes, if your workspace is connected to an identity provider, you can log in using SSO (Single Sign-On). This allows you to skip entering your login credentials each time you access Clockify. Admins can set up SSO from the Workspace settings.
What happens if I try to log in with an email address that is not associated with my account? #
If you attempt to log in with an email address that doesn’t have a Clockify account, you’ll be redirected to the signup page to create a new account with that email.
What is the SSO login process? #
Admins can set up Single Sign-On (SSO) by linking Clockify to an identity provider like Google Workspace, Okta, or Microsoft Azure AD. Once SSO is enabled, users can log in directly using their organization’s SSO credentials, bypassing the need for separate login details.
What should I do if my account is locked? #
If your account is locked due to multiple failed login attempts:
- You’ll receive an email notifying you of the lockout
- You can manually unlock your account by following the instructions in the email. The lock will automatically expire in 24 hours.
Can I use multiple accounts with Clockify? #
Yes, Clockify allows you to create and manage multiple workspaces. If you have different accounts or workspaces, you’ll need to log in separately to each one. You can switch between them from the workspace selector if you’re logged into multiple accounts.
