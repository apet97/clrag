Cancel subscription
If you’ve decided that canceling is the right choice for now, the process is quick and easy.
Steps to cancel your subscription #
- Open the menu next to your workspace name
- Choose Subscription from the dropdown
- Go to the Billing tab
- Find your current subscription plan
- Click Cancel subscription
- (Optional) Share feedback to help us improve
- Confirm your decision
After you cancel #
- You won’t be charged again after your current billing period ends
- Paid features will be available until the end of your current billing cycle
- You’ll be automatically switched to the Free plan after the paid period ends
- All your previous invoices are still available for download
- All your data stays safe – Clockify doesn’t delete anything unless you choose to remove your workspace or CAKE.com account
When you cancel your subscription, you’ll be asked to complete a brief survey. We’d appreciate your honest feedback to help us improve Clockify for the future.
Subscription changes don’t affect your content or data. However, after cancellation, changes to the Customer info tab will no longer be possible.
If you’re canceling a Bundle plan, all workspaces in your organization will be downgraded to the Free plan. Learn more about how Bundle subscriptions work in this article.
Before you cancel, you can explore switching to a different subscription plan that better suits your needs.
If payment for a past-due subscription is canceled, your subscription will end immediately.
