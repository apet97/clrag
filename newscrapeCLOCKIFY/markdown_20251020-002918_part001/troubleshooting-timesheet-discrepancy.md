Timesheet discrepancy
If you are seeing differences between your team member’s timesheet and what you see as an admin, it’s likely due to time zone differences in profile settings. Here’s why this happens and how to resolve it.
Why this happens #
- Clockify stores all time entries in UTC on the servers. What each user sees in the browser application is based on the time zone set in their profile settings.
- If a team member is in a different timezone than you, their time entries may appear to be on a different day or at different hours when you view them from your account.
- This doesn’t mean the data is incorrect; it’s just being displayed relative to each person’s local time.
How to resolve the discrepancy #
- Ask your team member to go to the “Preferences” settings under their profile
- Have them change their time zone to match yours
- Refresh the page to compare again
Once time zones are aligned, you will see matching times and dates for entries on the timesheet.
