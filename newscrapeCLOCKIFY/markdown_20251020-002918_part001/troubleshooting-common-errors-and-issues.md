Common errors and issues
Start time is greater than end time #
This error occurs when the start time in your API request is after the end time, often due to a mismatch between local time zones and UTC, which is what the Clockify API expects.
Why this happens:
- The Clockify API uses UTC time for all time-based values
- Sending a start time in local time (e.g., Brussels +1) without converting it to UTC may result in a start time that appears later than the end time.
How to fix it:
- Make sure both start and end times in your request are converted to UTC.
- Double-check the full API request:
- Endpoint used
- Request body and time fields
- Headers (especially Content-Type and authentication)
- Time zone settings on the server or script generating the request
Even if a non-UTC start time is accepted, the timer might begin with a negative duration, which can affect calculations and reporting. Converting to UTC resolves this issue completely.
403 – Forbidden #
This error means your request is understood by the server, but you’re not authorized to perform the action due to missing permissions or feature restrictions.
Why this happens:
- The API key being used doesn’t have permission for the requested operation
- The user’s role (e.g., Project Manager or a Team Manager) has limited access
- The subscription plan doesn’t include the requested feature
- You’re requesting a report with amounts, but you don’t have permission to view amounts
How to fix it:
- Check user role and permissions:
Make sure the API key belongs to a user with the correct role and access to the resource.
- Verify subscription:
Some endpoints and features require a paid plan, like “Add time for others”, for example.
- Regenerate your API key:
- Click on your Profile picture and select Preferences
- Open the Advanced tab
- Click Generate next to the API key field
- If generating a report as a Project or a Team Manager:
If amounts are restricted and you don’t have access, use the following parameter in your request:
“amountShown”: “HIDE_AMOUNT”
This will generate the report without including financial data.
401 – Unauthorized #
This error means authentication failed, usually because the API key is missing, invalid, or not authorized to access the requested source.
Why this happens:
- API key is missing, invalid, or incorrectly passed in the header
- API key is associated with a user who doesn’t have access to the endpoint
- The current subscription plan doesn’t support the requested feature
How to fix it:
- Verify that the API key is included correctly
X-Api-Key: your_api_key
- Check that the API key is valid:
- Click on your profile picture and select Preferences
- Open the Advanced tab
- Click Generate to create a new API key
- Ensure correct permissions
The user tied to the API key must have access to the requested workspace, project, or feature.
- Double-check your plan:
Some API endpoints are only available on paid plans, like “Add time for others”, for example.
400 – Required token or API key and 1000 – Full authentication required #
This error appears when the request is missing an authentication header, meaning the system doesn’t know who is making the request.
Why this happens:
- The API call is missing the X-Api-Key in the headers
- The request might be sent from a script or tool that didn’t properly include authentication info
How to fix it:
Include the following header in your request:
X-Api-Key: your_api_key
