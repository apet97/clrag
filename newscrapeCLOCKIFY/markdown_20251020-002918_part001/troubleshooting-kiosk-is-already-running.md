Kiosk is already running
This message usually means the system thinks there is an active session somewhere. Here’s how to fix it.
Free plan allows only one active kiosk #
If you are on the free plan, you can only have one kiosk active at a time. Trying to launch a second one will trigger this message.
What to do:
- Check if you already have an active kiosk running on another device or a browser tab
- If needed, close that kiosk before launching a new one
Multiple kiosks are available only on our paid plans.
Kiosk is already running #
Make sure the kiosk isn’t already open and active on another device. Ask your team or check the device it was last used on.
Deactivate and reactivate the kiosk #
If no one else is using the kiosk, try resetting it:
- Go to the Kiosks page from the sidebar
- Click on the three dots next to the kiosk and select Deactivate
- Once inactive, click on the three dots again and select Activate
- Copy the link and try launching it again
Clear browser memory or use incognito mode #
Your browser may be holding onto an old session.
- Try launching the kiosk in incognito/private mode
- Or clear the cache and cookies from the browser
