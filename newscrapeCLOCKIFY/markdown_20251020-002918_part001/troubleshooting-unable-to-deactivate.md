Unable to deactivate or delete a team member
If you are trying to deactivate someone from your team but the option isn’t available, it’s likely due to role permissions or the user’s account status. Here’s what to check.
The user is also an admin #
Admins cannot deactivate other admins; only the workspace owner has the permission to do this.
- If you are an admin and the user you’re trying to remove also has an admin role, the option will not appear
- To proceed, contact the workspace owner and ask them to deactivate the user
How to deactivate a team member #
If the user is not an admin, or you have the owner role assigned, you can deactivate them from the Team page:
- Navigate to the Team page from the sidebar
- Find the user you’d like to deactivate
- Click on the three dots on the right-hand side
- Select “Deactivate.”
This will remove the user’s access but retain all their time entries in the system.
The user hasn’t joined yet #
If the user has a “Not joined yet” tag, they can’t be removed from the team page. Instead, you’ll need to delete them from the CAKE.com account. Here’s how:
- Click on your profile picture and select “Manage CAKE.com account”
- Click on “Members” from the sidebar
- Find the user you’d like to delete and click on their name to expand the details
- Click on the three dots and select “Delete user”
Only the workspace owner can delete pending users from the account; admins do not have those permissions.
