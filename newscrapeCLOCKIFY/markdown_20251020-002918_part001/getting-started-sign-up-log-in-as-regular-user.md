Sign up & log in as regular user
If you’re a regular user looking to start using Clockify, this guide will walk you through the simple steps to sign up for an account and log in so you can begin tracking your work hours right away.
To get started, you’ll need to accept a workspace invitation, or log in to your existing one.
Here’s what you need to know:
Accept workspace invitation #
How to accept your workspace invitation
Follow these simple steps to accept your invitation and start tracking your time:
- You’ll receive an invitation email with a link to activate your account
- Open the email and click the activation link
- You’ll be prompted to verify your email address
- Follow the instructions to complete this step
Once your email is verified, log in to your Clockify account.
If you don’t have a Clockify account yet:
If you don’t have a Clockify account, to get started, sign up for an account. If you’re expecting an invitation and haven’t received an invitation, reach out to your company’s system administrator.
Sign up to Clockify
If you’d like to sign up and create a new account:
- Create your account on the signup page you’ve been redirected to
Enter your email
Sign up using your Google account - Verification code will be sent to your inbox
- Type in the code in provided prompts
You’ll automatically be added to the workspace and can start tracking time immediately.
If you already have a Clockify account:
- If you already use Clockify, you’ll receive an email and a notification in your Clockify account
- To accept the invitation, click the bell icon in the top right corner of the Clockify app, then click Accept
- After accepting, you can switch to the workspace and start tracking time
If you’re invited to a workspace with an email you already use for an existing Clockify account, you won’t be able to create a new account using the same email.
Once you accept the invitation, you’ll be able to switch between workspaces and start tracking time for the one you’ve been invited to.

Access Clockify via custom web address #

Once you’re logged in, you’ll be able to start tracking your time and reviewing your work logs while working with your team. Bookmark the page, so that you can easily find it the next time you need to log in.
If you have any questions or need more help, you can reach out to your administrator, or check out the rest of the guides in the Onboarding series.
FAQ #
What if I don’t receive the verification email? #
If you don’t receive the verification OTP code, check your spam or junk folder. If you still can’t find it, try resending the code by selecting the Resend OTP option on the verification page.
If the issue persists, contact our support team.
What if invitation link expires? #
There are two main reasons why your invitation link might expire:
- You’re already accepted the invite
Once you accept the invitation and create the account, the link becomes invalid. To check if you’ve already accepted, go to clockify.me and log in. If you have a pending invite, you’ll see a notification under the bell icon at the top right corner.
- Link has expired
Invitation links expire after 14 days. If you haven’t accepted the invitation during that time, the link is no longer valid. In that case, you need to contact a workspace admin to resolve this issue.
Can I access Clockify on multiple devices? #
Yes, you can log in to your Clockify account on multiple devices (desktop, web or mobile) using the same credentials. All your data will sync automatically across devices.
