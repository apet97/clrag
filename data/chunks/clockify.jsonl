But have you ever wondered how did we get an 8-hour workday? Today, we\u2019re bringing you the history of working 9-5 and how it became normal for employees to work 8 hours a day. Moreover, we\u2019ve created 8-hour and 7.5-hour workday calculators to help you avoid overworking and make sure you work precisely 8 hours and not a minute more! Key Takeaways: - Robert Owen is believed to have come up with the 8-hour workday concept. - Ford Motor is the first manufacturing company to introduce an 8-hour workday in the US. - Workday calculator can help you determine the exact time you need to end your workday. - You can make the most of your 8-hour workdays by planning your daily tasks in advance. - Research shows that working longer hours affects your mental and physical health. What is an 8-hour workday? An 8-hour workday is a standardized workday during which employees work 8 hours per day. They typically work 8-hour shifts for 5 days in a row, up to a total of 40 hours per week. While working 9-5 is considered the usual working time in the US, an 8-hour workday doesn\u2019t depend on the time you start working. Employees could work morning, evening, or night shifts as long as their hours worked don\u2019t exceed 8 hours. \ud83c\udf93 How to Make an 8-Hour Workday Schedule Work A history of the 8-hour workday If you were wondering who invented the 8-hour workday and how a 40-hour week became the norm for full-time employees, this section has the answers. In addition, you\u2019ll learn how working hours could change in the future. Early to mid-1800s: People work 10 and 16 hours per day, 6 days a week Until the mid-1800s, a typical worker in the manufacturing industry was required to work between 10 and 16 hours per day and have 6 working days a week. This translates to employees working nearly 100 hours per week. The impact of such long hours affected both the physical and mental health of workers, as work-life balance was practically non-existent. The 8-hour shift movement started in the early 1800s. A social reformer Robert Owen came up with the expression: \"Eight hours labor, eight hours recreation, eight hours rest.\"He is believed to be the inventor of the 8-hour workday. 1866\u20131938: The 8-hour workday movement After the Industrial Revolution, labor unions started advocating for change regarding the weekly hours of work. In 1866, the National Labor Union mandated that Congress pass a law limiting the workday to 8 hours. In 1869, President Ulysses S. Grant issued an 8-hour workday proclamation that promised 8-hour workdays to government employees only. At the end of the 1800s and in the early 1900s, many industries, including mining", "tokens": 1000, "node_type": "child"}

Grant issued an 8-hour workday proclamation that promised 8-hour workdays to government employees only. At the end of the 1800s and in the early 1900s, many industries, including mining and printing, introduced 8-hour days. The Labor Union\u2019s efforts finally came to fruition in 1938 when the Fair Labor Standards Act was passed. At first, the Act limited the workweek to 44 hours. But, in 1940, the FLSA was amended to limit the workweek to 40 hours. 1926: Henry Ford's revolutionary role in an 8-hour workday and 5-day workweek In 1926, the Ford Motor Company became one of the first in the US to adopt a 5-day, 40-hour workweek. This move significantly increased productivity, employee engagement, and loyalty. Henry Ford thus became one of the revolutionaries in the 40-hour workweek movement, setting the standard for others to follow. Aside from the 40-hour workweek, Ford also embraced the 9-to-5 working schedule. After him, many manufacturing facilities and factories also began working 9-5. Today, a 9-to-5 job is considered a norm for companies in nearly all industries. What does the future look like for the 8-hour workday? In recent years, employees have gone through major changes in the way they work. Remote and hybrid working arrangements became much more common. For many workers, this meant more work flexibility regarding both the place they work and their work hours. According to a 2023 FlexJobs survey, 77% of workers feel more productive when working remotely. In addition, 93% feel remote work improved their mental health, while 90% believe it benefited their physical well-being. As a result, this survey shows that 51% of employees prefer fully remote work, while 46% would like to have a hybrid working arrangement. What\u2019s more, a 4-day workweek became a topic of discussion after the major success of Iceland\u2019s 4-day workweek trials. Yet, Iceland is not the only country boasting the great results of a 4-day workweek implementation. In fact, a 4-day week in Spain resulted in healthier workers and less pollution. Moreover, a 2024 report by Autonomy on UK 4-day workweek trials shows that this arrangement proved beneficial even after years of its launch. Autonomy reported that 100% of CEOs and managers they consulted believe this arrangement had a positive impact on how their company operates. Furthermore, employees noted improvements in their physical and mental health, a better work-life balance, and overall life satisfaction. While a 4-day workweek comes with organizational challenges, we are likely to see this arrangement becoming increasingly present in the future of work discussions.

How do you calculate 8-hour working days? The 8-hour workday should end exactly 8 hours after an employee starts working. So, to calculate your 8-hour workday, write down the exact time your work began. Then, add 8 hours to this time to get the time your workday should end. You can use our working time calculator to get the exact time you should finish your work. \u23ec 8-hour working time calculator To start using the calculator, firstly, click on the calculator link and choose Make a copy. Then, simply enter the time you started working and the calculator does all the work for you. You can also add a.m. or p.m. or use the 24-hour format to specify the time your work began. How do you calculate an 8-hour workday with breaks? Breaks in an 8-hour day depend on: - Federal law, - State regulations, and - Company-specific rules and guidelines. Short breaks lasting between 5 and 20 minutes are not required by federal law. However, if a company policy allows these short breaks, that period counts as compensable (included in the total sum of hours worked). On the other hand, meal periods, which usually last 30 minutes, don\u2019t count as time spent working. Thus, they aren\u2019t compensable. As break regulations vary by state, make sure to check state laws before calculating employees' working hours and breaks. If you have to deduct a 30-minute break from your day, you can try our 7.5-hour working time calculator. It works the same as our 8-hour calculator. \u23ec 7.5-hour working time calculator Once you click on the link and choose the Make a copy option, you should enter the start time of your work. The calculator will then determine the time at which your workday should end. We also created a calculator that accounts for a 30-minute break. You can use it to determine the exact time your 7.5-hour shift, which includes a 30-minute break, ends. \u23ec 7.5-hour working time calculator with a 30-min break After clicking on the link that leads you to the calculator, choose Make a copy. You can then edit the sheet. We\u2019ve already added the 7.5-hour workday and accounted for your 30-minute break. So, you only need to add your workday start time, and the calculator will give you the exact time your shift should end. If you're working 8-hour shifts, what compensation are you entitled to? The Fair Labor Standards Act sets the ground rules for two crucial aspects of work compensation: minimum wage and overtime pay.

The Fair Labor Standards Act sets the ground rules for two crucial aspects of work compensation: minimum wage and overtime pay. On a federal level, the minimum wage currently sits at $7.25 for FLSA-covered employees. However, states have different minimum wages as the cost of living varies across the US. Thus, check out the state minimum wage laws to determine what you\u2019re entitled to. FLSA non-exempt workers whose shifts are longer than 8 hours or who have worked more than 40 hours per week receive overtime compensation. Exempt employees aren\u2019t entitled to overtime pay. The minimum overtime rate is 1.5 times a worker\u2019s regular hourly rate. Depending on state laws and regulations, the overtime rate can be higher. What are the benefits of an 8-hour workday? Benefits of a consistent 8-hour workday in a 5-day workweek include: - Less stressful workday due to a consistent 8-hour schedule, - Predictability in the hours worked each day which leads to easier work organization, and less procrastination, - Less chance of overworking as 8 hours is the norm, and - Simplified salary calculation process as most salaried positions consist of 8-hour working days. What are the disadvantages of an 8-hour workday? As this number of hours doesn\u2019t work for everyone, the 8-hour workday can come with several downsides, such as: - Reduced employee satisfaction, as a rigid 8-hour schedule won\u2019t suit workers whose biological prime time happens outside working hours, - Lack of motivation for employees who manage to complete their daily tasks before their workday is over, - No overtime pay, as workers are paid for overtime when the number of hours worked is above 8 hours, and - Fewer days off and more time spent commuting, as working no more than 8 hours a day means you reach the 40-hour workweek norm in 5 days, which leaves you with only 2 days off. How to organize your 8-hour workday to be most productive? The key to a productive workday is proper organization. Take a look at some expert tips on organizing an 8-hour workday. Tip #1: Plan your workday Your daily productivity depends on how effectively you plan your tasks. Founder of Teach.io, James Watts, notes that planning ensures you stay motivated: \u201cPlanning your day either the night before or in the morning can help you stay motivated and focused, so you're not struggling with what to prioritize during your workday. Ensure you invest time in high-value tasks.\u201d \ud83c\udf93 How to plan your day and stay organized A great way to plan your day is by creating to-do lists.

CMO and co-founder of Radical Storage, Giacomo Piva, explains that short-term goals and defining priorities are crucial for creating to-do lists: \u201cDefine priorities and create a to-do list with daily or at most weekly tasks/goals. I\u2019ve learned that focusing on what I can accomplish in the short term is way more efficient than planning for the month.\u201d On the topic of prioritizing, Burnout Coach and Self-Care Strategist Daniela Wolfe suggests the Eisenhower matrix: \u201cTools like the Eisenhower matrix are great at helping you prioritize \u2014 separating what's urgent and important, what's not urgent and not important, and everything in between.\u201d \ud83c\udf93 How to make a breakdown of your workday (with templates) Tip #2: Take breaks to stay productive A time management and productivity coach, Alexis Haselberger, believes we should take a break every time we feel we\u2019re losing focus: \u201cWhen you feel yourself starting to fidget, starting to feel unfocused, take a break. Instead of fighting yourself, listen to your mind and body and go for a walk around the block, to the kitchen for a glass of water, or just read a few pages, listen to a short podcast, or even scroll social media for 10 minutes.\u201d \ud83c\udf93 How to Stay Focused When Working on a Computer CMO of FloridaPanhandle.com, Brittany Betts, takes regular breaks to avoid burnout: \u201cOnce I finish my easier tasks and my afternoon tasks, I give myself a 10-minute break to regroup. This break ensures that I avoid burnout, and also that I return to my work feeling inspired and productive. During this time, I will talk to my peers in the shared office space and hopefully get some creative juices flowing.\u201d Piva takes breaks after every hour of work: \u201cWhen I don\u2019t have to solve urgent queries or get stacked in long calls, I usually work for about 1 hour and then take a short break (about 10-15 minutes). By taking a break I mean staying away from any kind of screen and doing something I enjoy.\u201d Tip #3: Remove distractions Removing distractions is one of the best ways to stay focused at work. Watts recommends shifting your work setup: \u201cStanding desks or a pilates ball can make a difference in how you focus. And a bit of background noise. Listen to white or brown noise to drown out distractions. Lighting can also help you stay focused. Ensure your workspace is bright enough to keep you going without straining your eyes.\u201d \ud83c\udf93 Effects of Workplace Distractions in 2023: Crucial Statistics Tip #4: Find your own rhythm Try out different techniques and track your time to see when you\u2019re most productive.

Then, create a schedule around your productive hours. Haselberger believes the best way to make the most of your day is to listen to your own body and mind: \u201cThere's no \"right\" schedule. So spend a few days tracking when you get your best work done, when you're lethargic, when you're most focused, when you're most creative. Then build a rough schedule around that. It's much easier to work with who you are than to say, force yourself to get up and be creative early in the morning because you've heard it's a good thing to do, if you're actually a night owl.\u201d \ud83c\udf93 Personal productivity guide: Maximize productivity with these methods and apps Tip #5: Reflect on your day Watts believes that a workday retrospective helps us better prepare for our next workday: \u201cSpend a few minutes at the end of your workday looking back at what you\u2019ve accomplished and what you need to tackle tomorrow. It\u2019s a great way to check out for the day and prepare for the next.\u201d The consequences of employees working longer than an 8-hour shift Various studies have shown that working long hours seriously impacts employees\u2019 physical and mental health. The National Library of Medicine published a meta-analysis on the effects of long working hours on employees. The analysis highlighted various older studies that showed the consequences of long working hours, including: - Chronic fatigue, - Stress, - Depression, - Anxiety, - Poor sleep quality, - Hypertension, - Poor mental health, and - A higher risk of cardiovascular diseases. In addition, the study concluded that employees who work long hours are more likely to suffer from: - Sleep disturbance and other sleeping issues, - Work-related injuries, and - Fatigue. Moreover, a study on long working hours in Europe found that working more than 55 hours a week is associated with a variety of health issues, such as: - Infections, - Musculoskeletal disorders, - Diabetes, and - Injuries. Furthermore, a study on long working hours in China showed a correlation between overworking and occupational stress, well-being, and depression. Thus, even though we live in a culture that praises workaholism, employers should refrain from asking employees to work long hours as much as possible. Such expectations can lead to career burnout as well as serious issues that affect workers\u2019 well-being. \ud83c\udf93 How to Improve the Quality of Work Life?

But how to make sure you\u2019re not overworking? We recommend keeping track of your work hours using time tracking software. Clockify is a free work hours tracker that allows you to: - Track every hour of work, - Input breaks, - Track overtime hours, - Assign work tasks to different projects, - Keep track of project progress, - Manage multiple projects and tasks, and - Get reports on hours worked during specific periods. Clockify lets you track the time you spend on work activities using a timer. You can start the timer once you begin a task and stop it once you finish or need a break. Then, restart the timer for that task when your break is over, or add a new task and start the timer. Immediately after, you\u2019ll see the total number of hours you worked that day so you\u2019ll know when it\u2019s time to end your workday. Alternatively, you can manually enter your workday activities and the time you spent on each one after your workday ends. In addition, the Clockify Dashboard provides an overview of time tracked during a specific period you entered. You can use it to review your working habits and ensure you consistently work eight hours during the week. Sources - Bauer, S. Maylander, A. (1919). The Road to the Eight-Hour Day.

What is a Balance Sheet? What does a Balance Sheet show? By definition, a Balance Sheet is a financial statement comprised of 3 different sections: Assets, Liabilities, and Equity. Each Balance Sheet covers a specific point in time and serves as a detailed financial balance showcasing Asset, Liability, and Equity data for an organization or company, during the point in time specified. In order for a company to draw up a healthy financial balance, you'll likely need to consider the best ways to lower your hourly cost and increase your hourly rate. What are the 3 parts of a Balance Sheet? According to the Balance Sheet theory, a standard Balance Sheet consists of 3 main sections: 1. Assets Assets include all resources the company owns that are of potential economic value in the future. The Assets we usually find on a Balance Sheet are Current Assets, Long-Term (Fixed) Assets, and Other Assets: Current Assets These are all the Assets that are intended to convert to cash within one year from the date specified on the Balance Sheet. Current Assets include: - Inventory \u2014 i.e. all finished goods and raw materials. - Accounts Receivable\u2014 i.e. the balance of money due for the goods and services provided, as well as projects completed, but still not paid by the clients and customers. - Prepaid Expenses \u2014 i.e. all the expenses due for the future, but already paid in advance. - Cash and Cash Equivalents \u2014 i.e. the entire amount of money a company or organization has secured in a bank, in the form of cash, deposit certificates, savings bonds, etc. - Short-Term Investments (Marketable Securities) \u2014 i.e. all securities that can be sold, or converted to cash within a short time period (from 3 to 12 months). Long-Term (Fixed) Assets These are all the assets that are NOT intended to convert to cash within one year from the date specified on the Balance Sheet. Long-Term (Fixed) Assets include: - Long-term investments \u2014 i.e. all stocks, bonds, and cash the company or organization plans to hold for more than 12 months. - Property costs \u2014 i.e. tangible assets such as land and buildings owned by the company and organization. - Equipment costs \u2014 i.e. tangible assets such as machinery, fixtures, and vehicles owned by the company or organization. - Intangible assets \u2014 i.e. all non-physical, long-lasting assets such as patents, trademarks, broadcasting rights, copyrights, etc. Other Assets These are all the assets that do NOT fall under Current Assets or Long-Term (Fixed) Assets. Other Assets include: - Deferred Tax Income \u2014 i.e. the difference between the payable income tax of a company (the result of their accounting methods) and the total tax expenses they report (as ordered by the tax laws). - Bond Issue Costs \u2014 i.e. all the registration and professional fees that come from the issuance of bonds.", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

Liabilities Liabilities include everything the company owes to outside parties, from financial debts to specific obligations. We distinguish between Current Liabilities and Long-Term Liabilities: Current Liabilities These are all the amounts due to be paid within one year from the date specified on the Balance Sheet. Current Liabilities include: - Short-Term Debts \u2014 i.e. all the debts that are supposed to be paid within one year from the date specified on the Balance Sheet, such as bank loans. - Wages Payable \u2014 i.e. al the amounts the employees have earned while working for the company or organization during a specified time period, but that have not yet been paid to them. - Dividends Payable \u2014 i.e. the cash dividends that have been declared within a company or organization, but have yet to be allocated to the stakeholders. - Accounts Payable \u2014 i.e. the money owed to creditors that has to be paid within a short time period, such as 90 days. - Income Taxes Payable \u2014 i.e. all taxes owed to the state and federal governments that need to be paid within one year from the date specified on the Balance Sheet. Long-Term Liabilities These are all the amounts that are NOT due to be paid within one year from the date specified on the Balance Sheet. Long-Term Liabilities include: - Long-Term Debts \u2014 i.e. all debts, mortgages, and notes that are due more than 12 months into the future from the date specified on the Balance Sheet. - Capital Lease Obligations \u2014 i.e. the debts and obligations related to capital lease that are due more than 12 months in the future from the date on the Balance Sheet. 3. Owner's Equity Owner's Equity (also known as the Shareholders' or Stockholders' Equity) are all the retained earnings that remain when you subtract Total Liabilities (Current and Long-Term Liabilities) from Total Assets (Current and Long-Term Assets). That formula goes as follows: Total Equity = Total Assets \u2212 Total Liabilities The Owner's Equity also includes the owner's investment. What are Balance Sheet Financial Ratios? The Financial Ratios on a Balance Sheet are financial metrics that determine the company's or organization's financial position \u2013 by using Assets, Liability, and Equity data to carry out the necessary calculations.

The Financial Ratios always determine the relationship between two Balance Sheet components \u2013 Assets and Liabilities, Liabilities and Equity, and Equity and Assets: Assets and Liabilities Financial Ratios Balance Sheet Financial Ratios that involve the relationship between the Assets and Liabilities include: The Debt Ratio \u2013 the measure that indicates the total amount of assets that are paid by making creditor debts.The Debt Ratio represents the relationship between Total Liabilities and Total Assets, and the formula goes as follows: The Debt Ratio = Total Liabilities/Total Assets A good Debt Ratio is usually a ratio of 0.4 (40%) or lower. The Current Ratio \u2013 the measure that indicates a company's ability to pay short-term debts and obligations within a year from the date specified on the Balance Sheet. The Current Ratio represents the relationship between Current Assets and Current Liabilities, and the formula goes as follows: The Current Ratio = Current Assets/Current Liabilities A good Current Ratio varies across industries, but it usually falls somewhere between the ratios of 0.015 (1.5%) and 0.03 (3%). The Quick Ratio \u2013 the measure that indicates a company's ability to pay short-term debts and obligations within a year from the date specified on the Balance Sheet, BUT only with its \"most liquid assets\" (excluding inventory). The Quick Ratio is the relationship between Current Assets and Current Liabilities, but without the Current Asset Inventories, and the formula goes as follows: The Quick Ratio = (Current Assets \u2212 Inventories)/Current Liabilities A good Quick Ratio is anything that is equal to or above 1, as it means that you are currently able to cover all your current debts and obligations by using only your most current assets.

How does a Balance Sheet work? Balance Sheets usually require the following data: - Your company's name and address - The date you'll use as a point of reference when deciding whether assets and liabilities are current or long-term - All relevant Current and Long-Term Assets - All relevant Current and Long-Term Liabilities - The Owner's Equity data - Formulas that help you analyze this data, such as the Balance Sheet Financial Ratios First, you add your company's basic information. Then, you add your relevant Current and Long-Term Assets And Liabilities, as well as the Owner's Equity data. Once you've done that, you may need to calculate the relevant Financial Ratios, and other similar data, on your own. However, if you're using a Balance Sheet Template created in Excel or Google Sheets, you'll be able to add the formulas that will make these calculations for you. So, when you enter your data about Assets, Liabilities, and Equity, the Financial Ratios will be calculated automatically. In addition, you can download a Balance Sheet, save as PDF, print out the template, and fill it out by hand. How does a Balance Sheet look like? A straightforward and comprehensive Balance Sheet is parsed by the type of data. For example, both the Assets and Liabilities are parsed into Current and Long-Term Assets and Liabilities. Moreover, the Owner's Equity data is also sectioned separately. The purpose of this is to allow for a quicker and simpler insight into the working capital of a company or organization, as well as to facilitate the relevant Financial Ratio calculations. Why is a Balance Sheet important? Why is a Balance Sheet used? A Balance Sheet is an important aid in helping: - Potential investors in a business - The companies running the said business By glancing at a Balance Sheet, business people gain insight into their potential investments as well as the current state of their own businesses: - The investors gain an insight into the operations and workings of a certain company \u2013 the Balance Sheet data helps potential investors decide whether they should invest in a company, or not. - The companies understand their financial standing \u2013 the Balance Sheet data helps owners understand how much they own, how much they owe, how much they are owed, and whether their business is solvent, or not.

Why is a Balance Sheet prepared? As evident, a Balance Sheet is usually prepared to serve as a report of a company's or organization's financial standing at the end of a specific accounting period. For example, a completed Balance Sheet may be required before midnight on the 31st of December. Such a Balance Sheet is used to cover the Assets, Liabilities, and Equity for the whole previous year. How do you create and structure a Balance Sheet template? You can create a reusable Balance Sheet Template in Excel or Google Sheets: - First, you add your company's basic data and the date you'll use as a point of reference to decide whether the Assets and Liabilities are Current or Long-Term: - Then, you add your relevant Assets, both Current and Long-Term: - Afterward, you add your relevant Liabilities, both Current and Long-Term: - In the end, you add your relevant Equity data: - Once you've added all these data, you'll use it to calculate Total Assets, Total Liabilities, and Total Equity. In addition, you'll use it to calculate the Financial Ratios, as well as understand how your company is performing, and whether you'll need to take some action to improve its position (and, potentially, save it from bankruptcy). Is a Balance Sheet an income statement? What is an Income Statement? Balance sheets are NOT income statements, but they do closely relate - together, they represent an entity's Total Financial State. As such, they are usually observed and analyzed together. An Income Statement, by definition, is the relationship between the inpour of resources (Revenue) and the output of resources (Expenses). The Revenue section of an Income Statement may include: - sales revenue - service revenue - interest revenue - other types of revenue The Expenses section of an Income Statement is more variable, and typically includes: - commissions - employee benefits - advertising - software costs - rent - equipment - other types of expenses To draw up your Income Statement, you'll need to subtract your Total Expenses from your Total Revenue. An Income Statement serves as a summary of all Revenues and Expenses during a specific time period. This specific time period is usually a year, but it may also be shorter than that, like a quarter of the year. When the Revenue is higher than the Expenses, their relationship is labeled as Net Income. This is the amount the company has gained during the specified time period. Here's an example of an income statement calculation, when the outcome is Net Income: Revenue = $5,000 Expenses = $3,000 Revenue - Expenses = Net Income $5,000 - $3,000 = $2,000 of Net Income When the Revenue is lower than the Expenses,", "tokens": 1000, "node_type": "child"}

The key thing a scheduling software should provide is a simple scheduling system that will make your daily work run smoothly. Besides its functionality and the extensive list of scheduling features, there are certain aspects that should be acknowledged when choosing a scheduling software. 1. Price One of the first things that can make or break a call to try out a certain software is the price. An unusually high price can instantly put off potential customers, especially while they\u2019re not still sure about the value they\u2019re getting. Ideally, a scheduling software should offer a free trial, to give potential users first-hand experience of the benefits they are getting, and how intuitive the software is for them. 2. Availability on devices Introducing new software to a company is the easiest when you don\u2019t have to make a huge shift in resources that you use. Ideally, new software should be available for the devices and operating systems that you currently use. 3. Reviews Checking customer reviews on the software that you\u2019re interested in helps you get to know the overall user impression of the software, what works great, and what is the biggest issue with using the software, or simply interacting with the company. 4. Customer service Apart from understanding the issues users ran into while using the software, reviews also provide insights on the experience users had with a company\u2019s support team - how soon they were contacted, how knowledgeable and kind was the support team, and whether the problem occurred again or was resolved after first try. How do we decide on the best scheduling software? The criteria that mentioned above are common ways of evaluating the expected quality of the software. But, each user will probably have personal preferences that are not in direct correlation with these criteria.

Clockify \u2022 Toggl Track \u2022 Harvest \u2022 Hubstaff \u2022 Time Doctor \u2022 Everhour \u2022 My Hours How I chose which time tracking apps to review With so many time tracking apps on the market, I needed to establish some ground rules for selecting the ones that would make it to the final list. Here are the key criteria I considered when making my selection: - Usability \u2014 a time tracker app should be simple to use, allowing users to track time effortlessly and streamline their workflow. - Core and additional features \u2014 aside from core timekeeping functionalities such as a timer and a manual-entry option, a great time tracker should also offer extra features like scheduling or advanced analytics. - Affordability \u2014 to accommodate different budgets, a time tracker should offer a free plan and affordable paid plans, or at least a free trial that allows users to test the app before committing. - Multiplatform availability \u2014 a time tracking tool should allow users to track time across various devices, enabling consistent timekeeping. Before selecting an app that falls short of your expectations, consider the following first: - How do you usually work? Are you a freelancer? Do you run a company? - How big is your team? - What is your planned budget for a time tracking app? - What are the basic features your time tracking app needs to have? \ud83c\udf93 How to Choose the Best Time Tracking Software Overview of the best time tracking software for 2025 I\u2019ve done a thorough analysis of the current market and singled out the top 7 time tracking apps based on my outlined criteria.

Since I prefer filling my timesheets manually at the end of the day, I use Clockify\u2019s timesheets to log my hours. I simply choose the Timesheet option from the sidebar, select the project, and add my work hours in the appropriate time slot. I can also edit my time entries by marking my time as billable or adding tags to my entries for better organization. To edit my time entry, I hover over it and click the 3 dots. Then, I adjust the time, add a description or tags, change the time entry\u2019s billable status, and click Save. Very easy and intuitive. With Clockify, you can ditch error-prone spreadsheets once and for all. The app makes employee time tracking simple and precise, regardless of team size. Why is Clockify best for simple and effective time tracking? Besides allowing me to track billable and non-billable hours, I like that Clockify helps me better understand my team\u2019s productivity. Once my team members complete their tasks, I can generate detailed time reports in Clockify based on their tracked time. Then, I get to analyze the data to identify areas for improvement. With Clockify\u2019s summary report, I can see who worked on what, when, and for how long, allowing me to assess my team\u2019s efficiency. To generate a summary report with Clockify, I need to: - Go to Clockify\u2019s web version, - Hover over the Reports section in the sidebar, and - Select Summary from the dropdown menu. Then, I can choose the desired time range (e.g., this week) and use filters to narrow down the data included in my report. I can filter the report by: - Team, - Client, - Project, - Task, - Tag, - Status, and - Description. Additionally, I can further break down the data by groups (e.g., project) and subgroups (e.g., user) for more detailed analysis. In the report, I can also see the total billable hours for the project and the total earnings based on tracked billable time. This information allows me to bill my clients accurately and avoid undercharging. Moreover, you can export the reports in PDF, CSV, or Excel format and customize them to your needs. Thanks to Clockify\u2019s powerful reporting capabilities, managers can improve resource utilization and team productivity with ease. What additional features does Clockify have?

To access the calendar view in Toggl Track, click on the Calendar tab on the Timer page. While helpful for visualizing time entries, Toggl Track\u2019s calendar view lacks certain functions, like the option to delete all entries for a given day in one action. This option would enable a quick clean-up of accidental or incorrect time entries, saving you time. To add a time entry in Toggl Track\u2019s calendar view, I need to click anywhere on the calendar, and a pop-up will appear where I can add time entry details. After I enter what I\u2019m working on, select the project, and specify start and end times, I just click the Add button, and my entry appears on the calendar.

How does Harvest work? With Harvest, I can track time by manually entering the time spent on my task once I\u2019ve completed it. To do this, I need to: - Navigate to the Timesheet section (accessible under the Time menu), - Click the green Track time button, - Select the project and task, - Enter my work hours (e.g., 7:30), and - Select the Save entry option. Adding a note is optional. I can also delete or edit my time entry in Harvest. To edit my time entry, I click on the Edit option on the Timesheet page, modify the time, date, project, or task associated with that entry, and click the Update entry button. The only thing I found lacking is the ability to change the billable status of a time entry directly within the log. For instance, to mark your task as billable or non-billable in Harvest, you need to take several actions (go to Projects, select a project, click the Edit project option, and then adjust the billability status of a specific task), which is time-consuming. If we ignore minor practicality issues, Harvest has proven to be a solid timekeeping solution, offering simple time recording options. Why is Harvest best for basic expense tracking? With Harvest\u2019s expense tracking feature, I can: - Track project-related expenses, - Mark them as billable or non-billable, and - Choose different expense categories (such as transportation, mileage, lodging, and others). To create an expense in Harvest, I navigate to the Expenses section and click on the + Track expenses button. Then, I need to: - Choose a project, - Select a category, - Enter the date and the amount, - Mark the expense as billable if I want to bill my client for it, and - Click the Save expense button. Attaching a receipt to the expense is optional. I can also edit my expenses, submit them for approval, or delete them. Note that in Harvest, once you submit your expenses for the week, you\u2019re submitting both time and expenses for that week (you can\u2019t submit just the expenses or the time entries for a specific week). I like that I can attach receipts to my expenses in Harvest. This option allows me to keep all the cost-related information organized and provide transparency to my clients, fostering trust. \ud83c\udf93 Smart Ways for Monthly Expense Tracking What additional features does Harvest have?

As a manager, you can also set recurring timesheet reminders for yourself to stay accountable. Apart from all that, Harvest also allows me to: - Get visual reports of my performance and project progress, - Edit and approve timesheets, - Create and send invoices, and - Look into my profitability analysis. Although Harvest integrates with many accounting and project management tools, it lacks direct payroll integrations. This may be a limitation for businesses that want to streamline payroll processes and save time and money. \ud83c\udf93 140 Payroll and Timesheet Memes to Brighten Your Day How easy is it to use Harvest? I found the app\u2019s interface a bit difficult to navigate at first. Specifically, it took me some time to locate the option to start a timer in Harvest, since it wasn\u2019t as clearly visible as I expected it to be. I had to access the Timesheet section, click the Track time button, and only then could I see the Start timer option. Aside from this minor inconvenience, I didn\u2019t encounter any problems while using Harvest, and I got used to the app quickly. Harvest pros To see some of the key advantages of using Harvest, check out the following list: - It allows you to take a picture of a receipt and attach it to an expense through the mobile app, allowing you to manage expenses efficiently, and - It offers the option to attach a time report or additional project information to an invoice before sending it to a client. Harvest cons Here are the biggest downsides of using Harvest: - Unlimited seats and projects are only available in paid plans, compared to Clockify, where you can invite as many users and create as many projects as you want in the free plan, and - It doesn\u2019t provide absence or offline tracking capabilities. What\u2019s new in Harvest? In June 2025, Harvest updated its profitability report. The Team and Tasks sections now show the cost, profit, and revenue associated with each team and task, allowing users to get deeper insights into their business profitability. | Free trial | Yes, 30-day free trial | | Free plan | Yes | | Cheapest paid plan | $11/seat/month if billed annually | | Availability | Android, iOS, Mac, Windows | Best suited for: Freelancers and small-to-medium-sized businesses in sectors like architecture, construction, accounting, consulting, and others. #4: Hubstaff \u2014 best for tracking locations Being one of the best time tracking apps for work, Hubstaff is go-to software for busy managers looking for a way to keep track of", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

How does Hubstaff work? To record time via Hubstaff\u2019s timer, I need to choose a project I\u2019m working on and click the play button to turn the timer on. Once I finish working, I stop the timer by clicking the stop button, and my time entry is automatically saved in the app. After my team members and I finish tracking time spent on tasks, I can open the daily view in Hubstaff and see all the relevant details concerning each time entry, including: - Project and task name, - Activity, - Idle time, - Duration, and - Start and end times. I can also see if time was tracked manually and the reason why it was recorded that way (e.g., Forgot to start/stop timer). When I want to edit or add time in Hubstaff, the app requires me to provide a reason for a manual change before saving the entry, which feels unnecessary. All in all, Hubstaff offers practical timekeeping functionalities, making the process of tracking time efficient. Why is Hubstaff best for tracking locations? Hubstaff lets me monitor employee locations and increase time tracking accuracy with GPS time tracking. To track my team members\u2019 locations with Hubstaff, I have to add job sites in the app. To create a job site in Hubstaff, I need to: - Navigate to the Locations menu in the sidebar, - Select the Job sites option, and - Click the Add job site button. Then, I need to enter a job site\u2019s name, address, and define the desired radius (time tracking is triggered when team members enter or leave the designated area). To continue with configuration and save a job site, I click the Next button. After clicking Next, I select team members and adjust automatic timer actions to start/stop the timer when they enter/leave the site for precise tracking. Finally, I click the Save button to save my job site. It looks like a long string of actions, but to my taste it\u2019s actually relatively easy to get a handle on. Once I create job sites and my team members start recording time via the mobile app, I can see where my employees are when tracking time by using the Map functionality. The Map option is located under the Locations menu. Tracking employee locations with Hubstaff offers several benefits, including improved accountability, more effective resource planning, and enhanced safety for field teams.

Hubstaff also comes with 30+ integrations, but streamlining your workflow with them has a hefty price tag attached. If you\u2019re interested in integrating Hubstaff with even just one of the offered apps, you\u2019ll be able to do it only after upgrading to the Grow plan ($7.50/seat/month). In case you\u2019re in for the unlimited number of integrations, you\u2019ll have to upgrade further to an even pricier option. How easy is it to use Hubstaff? Hubstaff comes off as less intuitive and clear-cut compared to some of its competitors. For instance, it took me a while to get a gist of the dashboard, due to the overwhelming number of functionalities available. Moreover, setting up Hubstaff requires a certain amount of time \u2014 which means a longer learning curve. Hubstaff pros Hubstaff\u2019s main benefits: - It offers scheduling and overtime tracking options, and - It allows you to create work break policies for easier employee break tracking. Hubstaff cons These are some bad sides of Hubstaff: - Its screenshot and activity tracking features can be perceived as intrusive and raise privacy concerns among employees, and - It isn\u2019t available as a Firefox or Edge browser extension. What\u2019s new in Hubstaff? Some of the Hubstaff updates in 2025 are the option to favorite your most used pages in Hubstaff for easy access and sync improvements for Deel integration.

In other words, I can quickly start a timer (e.g., if I have an urgent bug to work on) and allocate time to the right task later, which I found convenient. Everhour provides useful time tracking functionalities, including an auto-stop timer option and handy reminders, allowing for precise timekeeping. Why is Everhour best for task planning? Everhour lets me create and plan assignments for my team members more easily than ever.

I like that Everhour gives me the option to assign different colors to assignments. This allows me to easily distinguish tasks on a timeline and identify specific assignments at a glance. What additional features does Everhour have? Being a comprehensive tool with both basic and advanced time tracking features, Everhour is a good choice if you want to: - Mark billable hours, - Get reminders to track time, - Break projects down into smaller tasks, - Look into your team\u2019s attendance, - Approve timesheets, and - Set up and track your project\u2019s budget. The app also integrates seamlessly with Asana, ClickUp, Trello, Jira, and other popular tools. The only issue is that you\u2019ll have to upgrade to a paid plan to use these integrations. How easy is it to use Everhour? In my experience, using Everhour is quite simple. The app\u2019s interface is user-friendly, and the time tracking features are intuitive, making for a streamlined time recording process. Everhour pros Everhour provides the following benefits: - It allows you to track employee time off, and - It offers the option of creating client invoices based on billable time and expenses. Everhour cons These are the key downsides of using Everhour: - Its free plan supports 5 users only, and - It doesn\u2019t have a mobile app for Android. What\u2019s new in Everhour?

How does My Hours work? Once I create my account, I can track time in My Hours by entering work hours manually. To do so, I need to: - Go to the Track page, - Select a project I\u2019m working on, - Choose a task (optional), and - Enter my work hours in the appropriate time slot. My first impression was that this page looked outdated and clunky, especially with all the gray. To edit my time log, I need to click on the pen icon within a time slot field. Then, I can: - Change the project or task related to that entry, - Add description or tags, - Adjust start and end times, or - Change the entry\u2019s billable status. To apply the changes, I simply click the Save button. As one of the best free time tracking apps for employees, My Hours gives users flexibility in how they track their time by offering several time recording options. However, the app lacks offline tracking capabilities, which is a bit disappointing. Why is My Hours best for creating task templates? Instead of recreating the same tasks for each new project, with My Hours, I can apply a pre-built template and save time. To create a task template in My Hours, I need to: - Go to the Settings menu in the sidebar, - Select the Task templates option, and - Click the + New Task template button. Then, I need to name my task template and enter a description or billable rate. I can also check the Billable by default box. This way, the task from this template will always be added to projects as billable. After entering all the relevant details, I save a template by clicking the Save button. In My Hours, all task templates with the same task list name are automatically grouped in the same task list. And when I add a template to a project, I add a task list, not individual tasks. I found this convenient, as it allows me to add several tasks at once and set up my project faster. To add a task list template to a project in My Hours, I have to: - Select the Projects section from the sidebar, - Choose a project (in my case, Sample Project), and - Click on the Tasks tab. After that, I click on the + Task list templates menu and choose a template I want to use (in this case, Social media). As soon as I click on Add tasks, the template is automatically applied, which I found helpful", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

My Hours cons The biggest disadvantages of using My Hours: - It doesn\u2019t have a feature for resource scheduling, and - Certain options, like the ability to calculate rates or set budget alerts, are only available in paid plans. What\u2019s new in My Hours? As of July 2025, you can set the project field as mandatory for every time log (meaning users must select a project when logging their time).

Which time tracking app is the easiest to use? Clockify is the easiest time tracking app to use.

Which time tracking app is the most affordable? As I\u2019ve been inspecting the best time tracking apps, I noticed that most of the tools (except Time Doctor) offer a free plan.

The Bradford Factor score is: 0 All HR and operations managers, raise your hand if you feel overwhelmed by employee absences. As you try to manage emails, spreadsheets, and unexpected sick leaves, short and frequent absences can make it tough to keep everyone accountable. It\u2019s hard to enforce your attendance policy fairly when all you have are scattered notes and a feeling that something\u2019s not quite right. You need a clear and objective way to see the big picture. That\u2019s where the Bradford Factor calculator comes in. This simple tool provides a data-driven score that shows patterns of disruptive, frequent absences. Instead of relying on messy manual tracking, you can use the Bradford Factor to identify and address issues before they impact your business. Ready to see how it works? Let\u2019s dive in. What\u2019s the Bradford Factor? The Bradford Factor, also known as the Bradford Index or Bradford Score, is a simple formula used in Human Resources (HR) to measure the impact of employee absenteeism. It\u2019s not about the total number of days an employee is absent \u2014 it\u2019s designed to flag frequent, short-term absences. Essentially, the factor considers it more disruptive to have 1 employee take 5 separate sick days over a few months than to have 1 employee take 5 consecutive days of leave only once. Frequent instances of short-notice sick leave can halt projects and increase workload on other team members. The Bradford Index shows an objective score to help you identify and address this pattern of employee behavior. It typically resets once a year. \ud83c\udf93 Here\u2019s How to Deal With a Surge of PTO Requests Easily How to calculate the Bradford Score The formula for calculating the Bradford Factor is simple \u2014 you just need 2 numbers: - S \u2014 the total number of separate occasions of absence (every time an employee is off work, no matter how long, counts as 1 occasion) and - D \u2014 the total number of days of absence within a specific period (usually 52 weeks). Let\u2019s see how this works. For example, consider 2 employees, A and B, who have both taken 5 days off this year. Even though both employees have been absent for 5 days, employee B has a higher Bradford Score compared to employee A due to the number of times they requested time off. Now, you don\u2019t have to manually calculate this for 20, 50, or 100+ employees working at your company. Instead, you can use our free Bradford Factor calculator above and save time for more meaningful, productive tasks. All you need to do is: - Enter the number of times an employee asked for time off within a set period (typically 52 weeks) in the first row, - Put in their total number of days off work during that time in the second row, and - Get the automatic score in the last row.

Interpreting the Bradford Factor score You have the number, but what does it mean? The Bradford Index isn\u2019t a pass-or-fail test \u2014 it\u2019s an early warning system. It helps you identify which employees\u2019 absence patterns are concerning and require a closer look. The scores can be interpreted as levels, where each level suggests a different course of action. This is an example of how some companies might categorize the scores: - 0-50 \u2014 a low range that\u2019s considered healthy for most businesses and not too disruptive. - 51-200 \u2014 depending on which end of the range the score falls, there could be some potential reason for concern, especially if this pattern of absences is unusual for the employee. - 201-500 \u2014 a higher range that might warrant further HR review and support. - 500+ \u2014 a very high range that could hurt work, potentially triggering a more formal conversation with the employee, or a review under your company\u2019s attendance policy. The interpretation of scores and levels varies from business to business and highly depends on their absence management practices. Also, keep in mind that the Bradford Score is a tool for initiating conversations \u2014 not a reason for immediate disciplinary action. \ud83c\udf93 Best Leave Management Software: My Top 5 Picks Practical applications in HR and absence management The Bradford Factor can help you implement a fairer and more consistent approach to managing employee absenteeism. Instead of relying on guesswork, you can use this data to guide your HR strategy in the following ways. #1: Manage difficult conversations Conversations about attendance are never easy. The Bradford Factor gives you the objective data to move the discussion from a subjective feeling to a measurable fact. This approach makes the conversation less personal and more focused on the facts, which can lead to a more constructive outcome. \ud83c\udf93 Why Your Constructive Feedback Falls Flat With Your Employees #2: Promote fairness and consistency Manually tracking absences can lead to inconsistent application of your attendance policy. By using the Bradford Factor calculator across your organization, you ensure that every employee is measured by the same criteria. This demonstrates that the policy is applied consistently to everyone, which reduces the risk of legal challenges and improves employee trust. #3: Set clear policy practices A high Bradford Score can be a pre-defined trigger for specific actions within your attendance policy. For instance, your policy might state that a score of 150-200 requires an informal chat, while a score over 300 needs a formal review meeting.

This provides transparency for both managers and employees, so everyone knows what to expect. Common questions and criticisms The Bradford Factor is a useful tool, but it has its flaws. As an HR professional, it\u2019s essential to understand common concerns so that you can address them effectively and ensure the system is used fairly. Is Bradford Factor harsh on employees? This is the most common issue with the Bradford Score. Its focus on absence frequency can feel too strict for an employee who has several legitimate, short-term illnesses, such as migraines or minor colds. To counter this, the Bradford Index should be used as a prompt for supportive conversation \u2014 not as a punishment. The score can work well together with a clear company policy that considers individual circumstances. Does it account for long-term illnesses? The Bradford Factor calculator isn\u2019t meant for long-term absences. It specifically addresses frequent, short-term sick leaves. The formula focuses on the number of occasions of unplanned absences (S), so just one occasion of a long-term absence would still result in a low Bradford Score. For instance, an employee who has asked for a 20-day leave only once would have a Bradford Score of 20, which is still lower than an employee who has asked for 1-day leaves thrice (Bradford Score = 27). Your attendance policy should also include a separate provision for addressing long-term health issues. What about disability and legal compliance? When using the Bradford Factor, you must be mindful of legal obligations related to disability and other medical-related situations. In general, absences related to disability or a long-term medical condition should be handled separately. Always consult legal counsel and your company\u2019s specific policies to ensure full compliance. After all, the Bradford Score may help with management, but it can never replace a good HR practice. As attorney Lisa A. Cummings, Esq. explains, the Bradford Factor can\u2019t be used on its own, as there are variables that need to be considered regarding the employee\u2019s absence: \ud83c\udf93 More resources on different types of leaves: - Paid Family and Medical Leave (PFML) \u2013 State Guide - Paid Sick Leave Laws by State Guide for 2025 - Bereavement Leave by State \u2014 Guide for 2025 - Mental Health Leave of Absence \u2014 Guide for 2024 - Maternity Leave Laws by State \u2014 Guide for 2024 - Sabbatical Leave \u2014 Guide for 2024 Clockify: The all-in-one solution for smarter HR management The Bradford Factor calculator is a great start, but you can easily have a system that does all the work for you.

Learn how to easily calculate work hours, or automate the process with a payroll hours calculator and get accurate payroll calculations within seconds! Streamline your payroll process and free up your time for more important tasks. Two crucial steps for calculating work hours Calculating work hours is an integral part of your business operations, and that is why you need to do it correctly. To make the process easier, you should follow two essential steps we\u2019ll now cover. - Tracking hours worked - Calculating payroll Step #1: Tracking hours worked The first step in the payroll calculation involves tracking the time spent on each activity. Employees can track their time in several ways. They could either use: - Electronic timesheets, - Punching time clocks, - A time clock kiosk, or - A timer app. Modern timesheets, for instance, can show you an overview of employees\u2019 activities during the day, sorted by project. Step #2: Calculating payroll Once you\u2019ve obtained the data regarding your employees\u2019 hours worked, you can use it to calculate payroll. You could do that manually or use payroll tracker software. How to calculate payroll hours and minutes manually If you prefer calculating payroll on your own, you can do that by following these steps: - Convert all start and end times to a 24-hour format. Then, subtract the start time from the end time for each time card to get the number of hours worked. Let's say that you started working at 8 a.m. and finished your job at 5 p.m, which is 17:00 converted to the 24-hour format. Your calculation for the number of hours you worked goes like this: 17:00 - 08:00 = 9 So, you worked 9 hours. - Convert from clock time format to decimal number format by dividing the minutes worked by 60. For example, if you have worked 38 hours and 27 minutes, you can convert the minutes to decimal format by dividing 27 by 60: 27 / 60 = 0.45, Then, add the fraction you got to full hours to get the final number. Based on the previous example, your calculation will go like this: 38 + 0.45 = 38.45, In Excel, you can convert from clock format to decimal format by multiplying a cell with 24 (e.g. =A1*24) and formatting the resulting cell as a number, - Next, reduce the total duration by unpaid breaks (if any). - Then, add up all of the hours in the week to get the total hours for the weekly payroll. So, if you worked 8 hours Mon-Thu, and 6.45 hours on Friday, you'll calculate the total weekly hours like this: 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 6.45 = 38.45 - Finally, multiply the hourly rate by the total hours for each employee to determine gross pay. Let's say that your hourly rate equals the", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

Let's say that your hourly rate equals the US average of $11.01. Your weekly gross earnings will be: 38.45 x $11.01 = $423.33 How to calculate payroll hours automatically using software If calculating payroll hours manually sounds like a time-consuming process, you can opt for a time tracking software. Introducing time tracking to your team ultimately helps you acquire the most accurate payroll data, and ensures your employees receive adequate pay for their hours worked. In case you decide to go for a time tracking app such as Clockify, here's how you can obtain the most accurate numbers: - Define the default hourly rate for each employee, - Define special rates if you have projects that use a different rate, - In the time report, select the time range for which you need calculated hours (week, month, or a custom period), - Filter out time entries for an unpaid break or lunchtime, - The software will automatically get the total hours worked for each employee and calculate how much you need to pay them, and - Export the report as PDF or Excel in case you need to perform more advanced calculations. If you opt for time tracking using Clockify, you can get reports on your all time entries from all employees by going to Detailed report: - In the report's filter, select the team member for whom you need to calculate the payroll and press Filter, - Select the date range in the upper right corner (you can change the first day of the week in the User Settings), - Click on the Save icon to create a new saved report, - In the report's name field, write the employee's name and the date when the payment was made (eg. Jamie Davis 06/24/2022), - Repeat the process each week or month, and - Select the date range from the day after the last payment was made to the current day (eg. 06/24/2022 to 07/01/2022), to check how many hours have been accumulated after the last payment. 4 Tips to successfully calculate payroll hours Calculating payroll can take a lot of time, but there are ways to simplify this process. Let's go over 4 tips to keep in mind if you want to speed up your payroll calculation. Tip #1: Use time rounding To make payroll calculation simpler, employers are legally permitted to round employee hours worked to the nearest quarter or tenth of an hour for payroll purposes. If you are working with employees and not independent contractors, you won't always be able to round down your employees' time to", "tokens": 1000, "node_type": "child"}

Let's go over 4 tips to keep in mind if you want to speed up your payroll calculation. Tip #1: Use time rounding To make payroll calculation simpler, employers are legally permitted to round employee hours worked to the nearest quarter or tenth of an hour for payroll purposes. If you are working with employees and not independent contractors, you won't always be able to round down your employees' time to the nearest quarter hour, according to the Fair Labor Standards Act. That's because, in certain instances, rounding down employees' time could go against overtime regulations or minimum wage rates. As both of these types of regulations are protected by the law, breaking them could have legal consequences for employers. The Code of Federal Regulations states: \u201cEmployee time from 1 to 7 minutes may be rounded down, and thus not counted as hours worked, but employee time from 8 to 14 minutes must be rounded up and counted as a quarter hour of work time.\u201d What about rounding intervals? You can round time to the nearest five minutes, or one-tenth or a quarter of an hour (5, 6, 15). Some businesses opt for rounding to a tenth of an hour instead of a quarter. As a result, the final numbers are cleaner when converted to the decimal format. Is rounding necessary these days? Not really. Time rounding was a time-saving practice back when clerks processed payroll by hand. But thanks to modern technology, time rounding doesn't lessen the administrative cost of calculating payroll as it used to. Instead, the software can track time to the minute and calculate payroll down to a cent. If you rely on time rounding for other reasons, the software can still round each time entry to the nearest interval automatically. It will then use the rounded values when calculating payroll. Tip #2: Include the overtime work All of the hours worked above the regular 40-hour workweek count as overtime work. According to FLSA, it is typically paid at a 50% higher rate than regular work for non-exempt workers. For example, if an employee's hourly rate for regular hours is $10, their overtime rate will be: $10 x 1.5 =$15 A higher hourly rate for working during weekends or holidays is generally a matter of agreement between the employer and the employee. As long as the total hours worked don't exceed 40 hours per week, the pay rate isn't subject to federal or state laws. That is, unless you have a contract that stipulates otherwise, or you want to give employees financial incentives to work during holidays or weekends. When calculating payroll for these more advanced scenarios, it's best to export raw time data in Excel. Excel will then calculate payroll based on that data. In Clockify, employees can attach an \"overtime\" tag to an entry. That way, employers can use the Reports feature to access details on the overtime work of every employee.

In Clockify, employees can attach an \"overtime\" tag to an entry. That way, employers can use the Reports feature to access details on the overtime work of every employee. Calculating overtime can be a pretty complicated process. To make it easier, you can use various overtime calculators. Tip #3: Don't forget to factor in breaks Breaks usually last from 5 to 20 minutes for rest and 30 to 60 minutes for meals. Rest breaks are included in the total time an employee works. On the other hand, meal breaks can but don't have to be included. To account for breaks in the time tracking software like Clockify, you can use a Break kiosk feature. Alternatively, you could create a separate entry for breaks and categorize them either by project or using a tag: - Create a separate project by the name Time-off where you'll put all time entries for breaks, sick leave, holidays, etc. (e.g. spent 5h on Project A, 3h on ProjectB, and 1h on Time-off), or - Create a break, sick leave, or holiday tag. Employees can then create a 1h time entry, leave it without a project, mark it as non-billable, and attach the appropriate tag. Later in reports, you can filter out entries with those tags so they're not included when you calculate payroll or billable hours. By keeping breaks separate from project time logs, employees can account for all of their required eight-hour days. In addition, managers can see exactly how long their projects actually lasted. Tip #4: Use timesheets Filling out timesheets at the end of each workday is one of the best practices because it leaves much less room for error. Employees can change start and end times for each task, apply tags, leave notes, etc. To do that, they should select a task from the timesheet and enter the time they spent working on that specific task in total. The process shouldn't take longer than a minute. In case someone forgot to fill their timesheets, you can easily see that in the weekly report. The weekly report shows you how much time each employee tracked in total for each day in the week. However, keep in mind that although being able to edit timesheets is a handy option, you should lock timesheets after a certain time so no more changes can be made. Depending on how often you process payroll, you can lock timesheets for the previous period every week or month. That way, people have the chance to get their timesheets in order. Once timesheets are locked, you can export data. Then, you can start calculating work hours and payroll safely, knowing nothing will change.

This can be a hassle because US states are governed by both state and federal laws. Therefore, each state has characteristic laws depending on its: - Size, - Political climate, - Population, and - Various industries. California, the most populous US state, incorporates many state laws that often trump federal law in multiple areas, including California overtime law. In the following article, we\u2019ll go into detail on overtime calculations and California administrative exemption, as well as the correlation between rates and overtime. General overtime rules in California Before we dive into overtime rules, let\u2019s highlight that in California, a regular workday equals 8 hours of work, while a workweek means 40 hours of work. To be considered overtime, any employment needs to be: - Beyond 8 hours a day, - Beyond 40 hours a week, or - Beyond 6 days a week. According to California overtime law, non-exempt employees are guaranteed overtime pay of one-and-a-half times (1.5) their regular pay rate. In particular cases, which we\u2019ll explain shortly, non-exempt workers are entitled to double their regular pay rate. California overtime rules mandate the one-and-a-half times rule in the following situations: - If a non-exempt employee 18 years of age or older works more than 8 hours (up to and comprising 12 hours) in one day, and - If a non-exempt employee 18 years of age or older works up to and including 8 hours on the seventh consecutive day of work in one workweek. California overtime law mandates the double-time rule in the following situations: - If a non-exempt employee 18 years of age or older works more than 12 hours of work in one day, and - If a non-exempt employee 18 years of age or older works more than 8 hours on the seventh consecutive day of work in one workweek. All these provisions also apply to any minor 16-year-old and 17-year-old employees: - Who aren\u2019t, by law, obligated to attend school, and - For whom work is not prohibited by law. | Time worked in total | The overtime rate | | > 8 hours in a workday (up to and comprising 12 hours) | Regular hourly rate x 1.5 | | The first 8 hours on the 7th consecutive day of work | Regular hourly rate x 1.5 | | > 12 hours in a workday | Regular hourly rate x 2 | | > 8 hours on the 7th consecutive day of work | Regular", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

But, if an employee works 13 hours on Wednesday, this is how to calculate their overtime: - 1.5 times their regular rate for 4 hours (9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th hour), and - Double times their regular rate for 1 hour, i.e., the 13th hour of work. How do regular rates and overtime rates correlate in California? The overtime rates in California are based on regular rates. Regular rates are affirmed at the beginning of contractual obligations and can be hourly salaries or fixed salaries. For hourly employees, to get their regular rates, you need to include: - The rates they get paid per hour during a 40-hour workweek, - Shift differentials, and - The \u201cper hour value\u201d for non-hourly compensation. If employees get paid 2 different rates, overtime is calculated according to the average of the 2 rates, i.e., \u201cweighted average.\u201d To get the weighted average, you need to know your total amount for the workweek (including overtime amount) and divide it by the total hours worked (overtime hours are included). For example, suppose you work 8 hours at $20 rate and 2 hours at $25 rate during the same week. Here\u2019s how you can calculate your weighted average rate: (8 hours x $20/hour) + (2 hours x $25/hour) = $210 $210/10 hours = $21 (weighted average rate) For salaried employees, regular rates are calculated by dividing the annual salary by 52 weeks in a year, and 40 work hours in a week, for example: $30,000 / 52 / 40 = $14.42 In addition, for employees who are paid by the piece or commission, you can use the following method to calculate regular rates: - Divide the total earnings for one workweek (including overtime hours) by the total hours worked during a workweek (along with the overtime hours). Here\u2019s an example of an employee who worked 42 hours, including overtime, and earned $450 for 1 workweek: $450 (total earnings including overtime) / 42 hours (total hours worked, with overtime) = $10,71 How do you calculate overtime in California?

As per California overtime law, non-exempt employees are guaranteed overtime pay if they work more than 8 hours per day or more than 40 hours per week. \ud83c\udf93 Key Differences Between Exempt and Nonexempt Employees It\u2019s worth mentioning that California Labor Code 551 and California Labor Code 552 prescribe that employees must have at least 1 day of rest during the week. Let\u2019s see exactly how you can calculate your employees\u2019 overtime hours. How to calculate one-and-a-half times rates in California To revise, employers need to pay their employees 1.5 times their regular hourly rate: - For each hour worked over 8 per day (up to and including 12 hours a day), and - For the first 8 hours on the 7th consecutive day of work. Suppose your employee has a $30 regular hourly rate. Last week, they worked 9 hours over 5 weekdays. If a regular rate is $30, then an overtime rate would be: 1.5 x $30 (regular rate) = $45 (overtime rate) Since your employee has 5 hours of overtime in total (1 hour x 5 weekdays), the next step would be to multiply their overtime rate by 5: $45 (overtime rate) x 5 overtime hours = $225 Now, let\u2019s combine your worker\u2019s regular weekly pay and overtime pay: $30 (regular rate) x 8 hours = $240 (for 1 workday) $240 x 5 workdays = $1,200 (for 5 workdays) $1,200 (pay for regular hours worked) + $225 (pay for overtime hours worked) = $1,425 That amounts to $1,425 of total weekly pay. How to calculate double-time rates in California Employers need to pay their employees double times their regular hourly rate: - If employees work more than 12 hours of work in 1 day, and - If employees work more than 8 hours on the seventh consecutive day of work in 1 workweek. Let\u2019s say your worker tracked 13 hours of work on Monday. Again, their regular rate is $30. To calculate the double rate for this worker, you need to multiply their regular rate by 2: $30 (regular rate) x 2 = $60 (overtime rate) Since the employee had 13 hours, they\u2019re eligible for overtime of both 1.5 times and double time. This worker has: - 4 hours of 1.5 times overtime rate (9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th hour of overtime), and - 1 hour of double overtime rate (13th hour). Let\u2019s calculate the overtime hours: $45 (overtime rate of 1.5 times regular rate) x 4 hours of overtime = $180 $60 (overtime rate of double time regular rate) x 1 hour of overtime = $60 Thus, the final calculation would be: $180 + $60 = $240 (pay for overtime hours worked) How to calculate overtime in California with the California overtime calculator?

As of January 1, 2025, the minimum wage in California is $16.50 per hour. This applies to all employers, except employers working in industries with a higher minimum wage, like the fast-food and healthcare industries. Fast-food restaurant workers get a higher minimum wage of $20.00 per hour. Similarly, healthcare facility employees also receive a higher minimum wage, which depends on the type of healthcare facility \u2014 ranging from $18 to $25. Apart from specific industries, some California cities and counties also hold a higher minimum wage. For instance, while Oakland has a minimum wage of $16.89, West Hollywood has a minimum wage of $19.65 per hour. Interestingly, sheepherders have been eligible to receive a monthly minimum wage instead of an hourly one since 2001. On the other hand, goat herders became eligible for a monthly minimum wage in 2022. Such minimum wages are defined by AB 1066\u2019s Overtime Phase-In. In California, there used to be a difference between: - Minimum wage for employers with 25 or fewer employees, and - Minimum wage for employers with 26 or more employees. However, since 2023, all rates have been the same for all businesses \u2014 check the table below. | Year | 25 or fewer employees | 26 or more employees | | 2019 | $11.00/hour | $12.00/hour | | 2020 | $12.00/hour | $13.00/hour | | 2021 | $13.00/hour | $14.00/hour | | 2022 | $14.00/hour | $15.00/hour | | 2023 | $15.50/hour | $15.50/hour | | 2024 | $16.00/hour | $16.00/hour | | 2025 | $16.50/hour | $16.50/hour | Also, California mandates a higher", "tokens": 1000, "node_type": "child"}

So, all employers who are subject to both federal and California state law must implement the state minimum wage, as this wage gives more benefits to California employees. In addition, if a particular city or county has a higher minimum wage (higher than the federal or state minimum wage), employers must follow the local minimum wage. Additional overtime rules in California Let\u2019s go through some additional overtime rules you need to know about California overtime law. What is California Labor Code 511? According to the California Labor Code Section 511, an employer may require the employees to work up to and including 10 hours per day, within a 40-hour workweek, as a norm. In such cases, employers won\u2019t pay their employees for overtime hours. Before enabling such an alternative workweek, an employer must first organize a secret election in the workplace, giving their employees a chance to vote. If at least two-thirds of employees support the alternative workweek, then the employer has the right to start implementing this schedule. For instance, employers can schedule 10-hour shifts for 4 days a week. In such a case, employees are NOT entitled to be paid 1.5 overtime for the 2 extra hours, considering that they\u2019re not expected to work only 8 hours in the first place. Moreover, they\u2019re still working at most 40 hours per week. However, employees must receive overtime pay if they work: - More than the scheduled hours defined in the alternative workweek, or - More than 40 hours in a workweek. \ud83c\udf93 Everything You Need to Know About the 4-Day Work Week Concept Who is exempt from overtime in California? According to the California overtime rules, there are some exemptions to the overtime law in California: - Executive, administrative, and professional employees, - Workers in the computer software field who are paid by the hour \u2014 there are specific requirements for this group of workers, - City, county, or state employees, as well as workers in special districts, - Outside salespersons, - Employees who are a parent, child, a legally adopted child, or spouse of the employer, - Workers partaking in a national service program (like AmeriCorps), - Chauffeurs who have their work hours regulated by the US Department of Transportation Code of Federal Regulations, Title 49, and those who have their work hours regulated by the California Code of Regulations, Title 13, - Workers protected by a collective bargaining agreement who also must follow specific requirements; in addition, employees who have joined a", "tokens": 1000, "node_type": "child"}

Most of these groups have certain requirements they need to fulfill, which are all laid out in the official state overtime exemptions list. Apart from California administrative exemptions, this state has some exceptions to the general overtime law. For example, employees who are part of an adopted alternative workweek schedule, which we covered earlier in this article. Do salaried employees receive overtime in California? It depends on whether salaried employees are classified as exempt or non-exempt from the Federal Labor Standards Act. Usually, non-exempt employees are the ones paid by the hour. But some salaried employees may also be non-exempt. Keep in mind that: - Non-exempt salaried employees ARE entitled to overtime pay, and - Exempt salaried employees AREN\u2019T entitled to overtime pay. If salaried employees are getting paid at least twice the minimum hourly wage for a 40-hour workweek, they\u2019re exempt from getting paid for overtime. As mentioned above, this rule applies to salaried employees who work in creative, intellectual, or managerial fields of work and whose work mandates discretion and independent judgment. Since we know that the minimum wage in California is $16.50, we can calculate the amount a worker needs to get paid to be exempt from overtime (twice the minimum hourly wage for a 40-hour workweek):", "tokens": 1000, "node_type": "child"}

However, if a salaried employee makes at least $68.640 per year, they aren\u2019t eligible for overtime. \ud83c\udf93 Salary vs Hourly Pay \u2013 Pros and Cons Overtime law changes in California \u2014 flat bonuses California overtime rules also include flat sum bonuses. It\u2019s a nondiscretionary bonus and should be included when calculating the regular rate of pay and overtime rates. The law further regulates that such a bonus is compensation for: - Hours worked, - Production or proficiency, - A reward to remain in the same company. This law was established after the ruling in the Alvarado v. Dart Container Corp. of California case. The case was caused by a dispute over the bonus amount that employees in Dart Container Corp. were supposed to receive for completing their weekend shifts. To explain the law (and its difference with old practices), let\u2019s take the following numbers for our example calculations: - $25 hourly rate, - 50 hours worked in total, and - A flat bonus of $200 as a base. Dart Container Corp. total pay calculations Dart Container Corp. used the federal formula to calculate the weekly pay of employees based on the total number of hours worked. They calculated the regular pay rate by multiplying the regular rate per hour by the total number of hours worked per week: $25 x 50 = $1,250 Then, they added this weekly amount to the received bonus and divided it by the number of total hours worked: ($1,250 + $200) / 50 = $29 According to the FLSA and the overtime rate for the employee ($29 x 1.5 = $43.5), the employee would then be entitled to an amount of $1,595 for that week (40 x $29 + 10 x $43.5). However, that turned out to be a legally problematic calculation. \ud83c\udf93 Pay Rates 101: Understanding How Pay Is Calculated in the Workplace Alvarado\u2019s total pay calculations The other party in the case, Hector Alvarado, complained that the Dart Container Corp. was underpaying its employees because it wasn't following the California Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE) Manual.

According to Alvarado (and the said Manual), Dart Container Corp. should have used only the number of non-overtime hours worked for the divisions, and not the total. If we take the same numbers from the previous example, that means $1,450 (weekly pay of $1,250 plus $200 bonus) should be divided by 40 and not 50: ($1,250 + $200) / 40 = $36.25 So, a regular rate is $36.25, which amounts to $1,993.8 of total weekly pay owed: $36.25 x 40 = $1,450 (regular rate compensation) $54.38 (i.e., $36.25 x 1.5) x 10 = $543.8 (overtime rate compensation) $1,450 + $543.8 = $1,993.8 (total) The ruling of the Alvarado v. The Dart Container Corp. of California case was added to the California overtime law. Hence, all overtime based on flat bonuses should be calculated accordingly. What else do you need to know about overtime in California? Here are some additional overtime information in California that might be of use to you: - The employee\u2019s right to collect overtime pay can\u2019t be waived. - If the employee receives less than the amount they\u2019re entitled to (including both the legal minimum wage and overtime compensation), they have the right to demand this unpaid difference in a civil action. - Commute time can count towards regular work or overtime, but only if employees are paid a fixed hourly rate for the work they perform (in such a case, travel time can be paid at a regular rate or overtime rate). - Employers are obligated to pay their employees for overtime hours, both authorized and unauthorized. - If an employee refuses to work on the 7th consecutive day in a workweek, an employer can\u2019t punish the employee. Frequently asked questions about overtime in California Throughout this article, we\u2019ve covered the most important aspects of California\u2019s overtime law. Nonetheless, we\u2019ve included an FAQ section with additional questions about California overtime calculation to make this guide as comprehensive as possible. Is anything over 40 hours overtime in California? Yes, any hours over 40 in a workweek are overtime. Non-exempt employees who work more than 40 hours in a workweek are qualified for overtime pay of one-and-a-half (1.5) times their regular pay rate, or double times their regular pay rate when applicable. What is the \u201c8 and 80\u201d rule for overtime in California? The \u201c8 and 80\u201d overtime rule is used in hospitals and residential care facilities, as they use a 14-day work period instead of the standard 40-hour workweek.

Also, a double time rate is mandatory for employees who work more than 12 hours in a workday. \ud83c\udf93 How to Cope With Working Long Hours Can you work four 10-hour shifts without overtime in California? Yes, this is an alternative workweek schedule known as a 4/10 work schedule. Employees who work 10 hours in a workday and 4 days in a workweek are not entitled to overtime pay. However, this is only the case if they weren\u2019t initially expected to work 8 hours a day. Are 12-hour shifts legal in California? Yes, 12-hour shifts are legal in California. However, employees who work more than 12 hours a day are eligible for overtime pay at double their regular rate for those extra hours. What if my employer refuses to pay me overtime? If the employer doesn\u2019t pay you overtime, you have the right to either: - File a wage claim, or - Start a lawsuit against your employer in court. Another option, if the company no longer employs you, is to file a claim for the waiting time penalty. Can an employer force you to work overtime in California? According to California overtime law, an employer has the right to force you to work overtime. In the same manner, if an employee refuses to work overtime, an employer can discipline the employee or even fire them. However, rules are a bit different when it comes to the 7th day of a workweek. Namely, if a worker refuses to work their shift on the 7th consecutive day, an employer doesn\u2019t have the right to discipline them. As we\u2019ve already mentioned, California Labor Code 551 and 552 mandate at least 1 day of rest during the week. What state has the highest rate of overtime pay? California is the only US state that has a double rate of overtime pay for non-exempt employees working more than 12 hours in one day, and more than 8 hours on the seventh consecutive day of work in 1 workweek. All other US states have the rule that the overtime rate equals 1.5 times the regular rate of pay. Does PTO count towards overtime in California? No, PTO doesn\u2019t count as overtime in California. According to the FLSA, employers aren\u2019t obligated to provide their employees with holidays, vacation, or sick leave.

The rules are the same for authorized and unauthorized overtime. Employees working overtime must be paid for these hours, either 1.5 times or double times their regular rate. California overtime laws regulate that all employees must be compensated for their overtime hours, i.e., any hours workers are \u201csuffered or permitted to work, whether or not required to do so.\u201d What does the \u201csuffer and permit\u201d rule mean for employees and employers? According to John-Paul Deol, Partner and Head of Employment Law at a nationally recognized law firm, the \u201csuffer and permit\u201d rule refers to when a non-exempt employee works overtime and the employer knows about it, or reasonably should know about it. Our interlocutor says that employers must pay their employees for overtime in such situations, even if the employer didn\u2019t expressly authorize the work. He also explains the purpose of the \u201csuffer and permit\u201d rule: \u201cThe rule is designed to ensure employees are paid for all hours actually worked beyond their standard schedule. It imposes a duty on employers to monitor and prevent unauthorized overtime.\u201d Our expert interlocutor further explains that if the employer is aware of extra work by the employee, the employer is deemed to have \u201csuffered or permitted\u201d that work and must pay the applicable overtime rate.

Even if you're not an economics major, you've likely heard them before. Supply and demand play a vital role in capacity management, but these two terms are just one piece of the puzzle. It takes a lot more to understand how to effectively manage capacity and why that's important for projects' and companies' success. In this guide, we'll shed light on capacity management: - Its definition and examples, - The process of managing capacity, - Capacity management importance, - The challenges that may occur when managing capacity, and - Capacity management strategies you can follow to overcome the most common issues. What is capacity management? (+ important capacity terms) Capacity management is the process of ensuring that companies maximize their production output. With proper capacity management, businesses can keep an eye on how much they can achieve, produce, or sell within a particular period. Before we go into further details about what capacity management entails, let's first define some of the most important terms related to capacity: - Component, - Capacity, - Capacity plan, - Capacity report, - Capacity management information system (CMIS), - Performance, and - Capacity managers. Component A component is a fundamental structure of a particular service, an essential part of a service. For example, the database is the component of an app or a server. Since components are so significant, they have to be purchased, built, maintained, and monitored. Capacity According to the CIPS Institute, capacity represents the available resources that can be leveraged to meet a certain level of demand. So, for instance, in a hotel, capacity would be the number of rooms, the availability of staff, and the hours during which hotel employees are working. In a restaurant, capacity would be the number of tables and chairs available, the availability of restaurant staff, and the opening times. Capacity plan A capacity plan covers different scenarios for anticipated business demands. Thanks to capacity plans, companies can make the best decisions on how to provide their customers with quality services while keeping prices cost-effective. Capacity report A capacity report is a document that contains data about service and resource usage and performance. Keeping an eye on capacity reports helps managers make decisions about individual components. Capacity management information system The capacity management information system (CMIS) is the virtual repository that gathers all the data about capacity in one place. Performance Performance is a metric that shows how quickly a system is able to respond to requests. For instance, how quickly an app can process data. Capacity managers In addition to these terms, we should also mention capacity managers. Capacity managers oversee the entire capacity management process. They make recommendations regarding resources and their re-allocation. Also, capacity managers make plans for short, medium, and long-term business needs.

Capacity managers In addition to these terms, we should also mention capacity managers. Capacity managers oversee the entire capacity management process.

The process of capacity management The process of managing capacity covers the matter of demand and supply of resources. Demand means the number of products, items, or services that clients or customers are willing to purchase at a particular price. Supply refers to the number of products, items, or services that companies can provide for their customers or clients, at a particular price. Speaking of resources, capacity management covers resources like: - Human capital, - Hardware, - Networking equipment, - Peripherals, and - Software. When it comes to human capital, organizations have to figure out whether they have enough workforce. Companies may find the following questions useful: - Do we have enough employees to cover all our projects? - Do we have enough projects to provide our employees with a workload? Learn more: What is workforce management and how it works? Additionally, leaders need to think about their team in order to equally delegate workload. Therefore, to schedule projects and employees properly, leaders have to answer these questions: - Who is busy and who can handle more tasks? - Who is overworked? - When will particular members be available to start working on a new project? Regardless of the type of business they operate in, companies must be flexible and adaptable to meet expectations from clients or customers. So, implementing an improved capacity management system may include actions such as: - Working overtime, - Outsourcing company operations, - Buying additional equipment, and - Selling commercial property. Examples of capacity management In order to understand capacity management, we need to consider its two vital elements \u2014 supply and demand. Let's look at these examples of supply on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis: - A fast-food truck that can make 700 sandwiches per day. - A call center that can conduct 1,200 calls per week. - A toy factory that can put together 5,000 toys per month. If there's a demand for 700 sandwiches per day, and this demand is always met, this fast-food company is working well \u2014 so this is an example of efficient capacity management. That means this company has enough employees to cover daily demands during their working hours. Moreover, this fast-food truck likely has sufficient equipment, hardware, software, and peripherals that employees can use when working. Now, what if demands change? What if there's a greater demand for sandwiches daily (1,000 per day)? In that case, the fast-food company needs to adapt its capacity management. When it comes to this fast-food company, they can decide to outsource some parts of its operations, like baking sandwich buns. Instead of doing this by themselves, the fast-food company can hire a bakery. Thus, employees working in this fast-food business will save valuable time (since", "tokens": 1000, "node_type": "child"}

Instead of doing this by themselves, the fast-food company can hire a bakery. Thus, employees working in this fast-food business will save valuable time (since they won't bake anymore) and use it to make 1,000 sandwiches per day. On the other hand, if the call center has to enhance its capacity management in order to conduct 1,500 calls per week (instead of previously-mentioned 1,200), they may opt for working overtime. Furthermore, let's say that the toy factory has to produce 7,000 toys per month (instead of the usual 5,000), before the Christmas season. To level up their capacity management, the toy factory can choose to buy additional equipment or machinery. What are the main elements of capacity management? There are four main elements of capacity management: - Business capacity management - Service capacity management - Component capacity management - Capacity management reporting Let's dive deeper into each element. Business capacity management Business capacity management covers business needs and plans regarding IT services and infrastructure. This sub-process includes reviewing all the data about demands. That way, companies make sure that the IT service will be completed correctly. Service capacity management Service capacity management involves predicting, managing, and controlling the performance of the operational IT services, from the beginning of the project to its end. This sub-process reviews the resources, working patterns of the IT service, as well as the lows and peaks of this service. Component capacity management Component capacity management covers handling and overseeing the performance, usage, and capacity of each IT component. Since hardware components usually have a specific capacity, these capacities need to be measured. That way, component capacity management ensures that there aren't any performance-related problems. Capacity management reporting Capacity management reporting provides other service management processes and IT management with important data about service capacity, service usage, and service performance. The data is then presented in the service capacity report What are the objectives of capacity management? The main objectives of capacity management are: - Identifying the demands of IT capacity. That way, companies are able to meet current and future workload demands. - Developing and maintaining a capacity plan. - Giving guidance and advice regarding capacity and performance. - Ensuring that service performance achievements are aligned with their targets. - Assisting when issues arise by providing diagnosis and coming up with solutions to these problems. - Improving performance by taking proactive measures. Capacity management process The capacity management process includes the following steps: - Establishing company's plans - Evaluating customer demands and opportunities - Analyzing the output of current infrastructure and resources - Carrying out capacity planning - Tracking and reviewing production capacity Now, let's see what each of these processes cover.

Capacity management process The capacity management process includes the following steps: - Establishing company's plans - Evaluating customer demands and opportunities - Analyzing the output of current infrastructure and resources - Carrying out capacity planning - Tracking and reviewing production capacity Now, let's see what each of these processes cover. Step 1: Establishing company's plans The first step of the capacity management process is quite straightforward. Businesses need to know the exact demand for production in the months ahead. That's the most efficient way to manage capacity. When having a clearer understanding of the company's plans, the company management will be able to decide whether to hire more employees or if machine maintenance is needed. Step 2: Evaluating customer demands and opportunities The next step in the capacity management process is understanding the market trends throughout the year. Thus, businesses will be able to forecast customer demands more precisely. For instance, market trends can cover some crucial events, such as the Super Bowl, or seasonal trends, like Christmas or Easter season. Let's use the aforementioned example of a toy factory. The Christmas season is approaching, and the company has to meet the demand of its customers. Instead of putting together 5,000 toys per month, they'll have to increase the number of products to a total of 7,000 toys per month. So, during October and November, this is the customer demand of the toy factory. Step 3: Analyzing the output of current infrastructure and resources Now that companies are aware of the future demands, company management needs to follow the third step \u2014 analyzing the output of current infrastructure and resources. In other words, will companies be able to meet customer demand with their existing resources and infrastructure? If not, businesses will have to lease or buy new machinery or equipment. Furthermore, companies may have to hire new employees to operate this equipment or perform other tasks. In the case of the toy factory, the company may decide to buy additional machinery. Moreover, the company will need to figure out whether they have enough toy designers to come up with ideas for new toys. To do so, managers should first analyze whether their current toy designers are available for this vital Christmas project, or whether they have to hire more designers. Once they gather the team, leaders have to create project schedules. Since Clockify can also be used as a project scheduling tool, managers can use the scheduling feature to plan projects on a timeline. As you can see from the screenshot above, you can add different project stages to the timeline, like a project kick-off or client meetings. You can also add or remove team members, as well as include milestones to remember crucial stages of the project. Let's recall our toy factory example.

Higher customer demands during the Christmas season imply more work for the entire team of toy designers. So, managers can use the scheduling feature to review employees' schedules and delegate the workload. As we can see in the screenshot above, schedules can be: - Full: employees' workload is at their full capacity. - Open: employees have time for additional work. - Over: employees' workload is over their capacity. This way, managers will figure out whether they have enough resources for the current project. Step 4: Carrying out capacity planning regarding the decision Once companies complete the third step \u2014 decide whether they have enough infrastructure and resources to meet demands, the next logical step is implementation. If businesses decide to purchase new equipment or machinery, then this step is buying new machinery and installing them. Once this part is completed, companies will be able to match the demand and supply. Step 5: Tracking and reviewing production capacity The final step of the capacity management process is making sure that the capacity plan works well and suits the company's needs. Therefore, businesses need to constantly track and review the process related to capacity. Why is capacity management important? Here are the most crucial benefits of capacity management: - It provides enhanced performance and availability of IT services. - It helps companies figure out what activities are long-term and strategic, and what activities are daily operations assignments. - It ensures fewer issues and incidents when it comes to capacity and performance. - It ensures that necessary capacity and performance are profitable. - It advances the reliability of the budget related to capacity. What are the different challenges of capacity management? We talked about the importance of capacity management in the workspace. Now, managing capacity isn't always an easy task. According to the Forbes article, these are the most common challenges related to capacity management: - The data challenge - The challenge of complexity - The communication challenge Let's explore each one in more detail. The data challenge Capacity planners handle a lot of information that they usually enter in manual spreadsheets. To have a proper capacity management process, the data inputs have to be accurate and written in the right format (the same units of measure). As you can imagine, making mistakes by writing down incorrect information can affect the entire process of managing capacity. Once capacity planners add the data, they also need to include details regarding demand and supply, then use a formula that helps them see information about available capacity. The challenge of complexity This challenge is in line with the previous one. Since capacity planners work with", "tokens": 1000, "node_type": "child"}

Once capacity planners add the data, they also need to include details regarding demand and supply, then use a formula that helps them see information about available capacity. The challenge of complexity This challenge is in line with the previous one. Since capacity planners work with formulas and calculations, there will likely be some mistakes along the way. Just like we mentioned earlier, adding wrong data to the spreadsheets can harm the entire process. In addition, things can get even more complicated because capacity management usually involves multiple levels in manufacturing. Completing each of these levels takes time and requires additional data. Therefore, getting a final capacity plan involves so many employees, which increases the risk that someone makes (an unintentional) mistake \u2014 which brings us to the next challenge. The communication challenge To prevent making any mistakes when entering data, it's important that all employees involved in capacity management regularly exchange information. Thus, keeping communication clear and transparent is crucial for the success of capacity management. When there aren't any communication gaps between employees, it's more likely that the process of managing capacity will be done accurately. Now that we've talked about the challenges that may occur during this process, let's explore the most effective strategies for overcoming issues. Capacity management strategies The most practical capacity management strategies you can use are: - Lag strategy - Lead strategy - Dynamic strategy - Match strategy We'll further explain how you can make the most of each strategy. Lag strategy The first step that capacity managers take in this strategy is determining the capacity. Then, capacity managers wait for an increase in demand. That's the sign that managers should enhance production capabilities to meet market needs. Although quite useful, this strategy has one key drawback. If market demands happen too quickly, companies might miss their opportunities to sell more products/services. That's because enhancing production capabilities takes time. Lead strategy Compared to the Lag strategy, the Lead strategy is riskier and more aggressive. When using Lead strategy, capacity managers make decisions to enhance the capacity even though there's no actual demand on a market. Managers assume that there will be demands and hope that the enhanced capacity will be sufficient. Now, in what cases do companies conduct this strategy? It usually happens when companies expand. In addition, companies working in industries with frequent sales demands usually opt for a Lead strategy. The main issue with this strategy is that it's risky. If demands don't increase, then the inventory storage costs can only go higher, which is yet another problem for companies. Consequently, when there's more capacity in inventory storage than needed, there's a risk of inventory wastage. Dynamic strategy This strategy is much safer than the previous one. In Dynamic strategy, capacity managers evaluate the actual demands on the", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

In Dynamic strategy, capacity managers evaluate the actual demands on the market and sales forecast data. Then, according to the current demands, capacity managers modify production, so it fits demands. Dynamic strategy is a very safe way to properly take care of capacity management because managers make decisions following the forecasted data. Furthermore, there's less chance for wastage of inventory, too. Match strategy This strategy is a mixture of Lead and Lag strategies. Here's how the Match strategy works: when it's evident that demands will increase, companies enhance their production in small amounts. Just like the Dynamic strategy, this one is a pretty safe solution as well. If demands level up quickly, companies can boost their sales a bit, since they've already increased production in small amounts. On the other hand, if demands don't go up, companies won't have any losses because they've only enhanced production for a bit. The key downside of this strategy is that businesses will never experience a peak in demand. Additionally, companies won't be able to escape sudden recession on a market. Conclusion Capacity management is the best method companies can use to maximize their production output.

Response has been very good. The software answers the 3 key questions we have about our team. 1.) What did you work on today? 2) How much time have you been spending on any one project? 3) What projects are in the mix? Having the ability to mark billable vs. non-billable is a feature we will use as well. It had all the features I needed AND NONE of the ones I did not want. So it was not un-necessarily complicated. Thus the ease of use and intuitive nature of the software was excellent. The free price tag for these basic functions was a bonus. Overall, perfect for our needs. \u2014 Justin N.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Never fail to bill your clients ever again Clockify is ideal for my needs. I work part-time for a client working as his executive assistant and his bookkeeper. I was getting myself in a mess just using a timesheet created in MS Excel and when I discovered Clockify I was over the moon with joy. I keep Clockify open in the background and I switch projects when I start the work and when I finish the work. I used to under invoice for my time and lose income but now I can bill for every second I work on his projects. Also, it has great reporting function and can either print off or save as a PDF or Excel etc. So not only do I invoice my client, I've also got exact data for the time I carry out each of his tasks. \u2014 Ruth M.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Great time tracking software, cheap cost, high vlaue Value for money is insane.

A logo here, a little code there. I did not realize how much time I wasted until I started using Clockify. I did try a couple of other apps but none was that easy and offered similar tools. Once I got everything ready and started counting my hours I fast figured out how much I actually needed Clockify. The times of lost hours are gone. I have a clear overview and know with a couple of clicks how much time I spend on each project and even know what my client has to be charged. In a couple of days Clockify turned into one of my favorite tools and I use it now every single day. Incredible easy and fast to use. Tools for every platform I needed from Android over Mac OS to Windows I use them all.

Unlike most time tracking software, this one is built and centered around at most maybe 3 buttons, so I got started with it right away. Due to its simplicity, even the free trial gives you all the functionality you'd mostly need. Integration with Google Calendar. I am an active user of Google Calendar, and connecting Clockify to GCal through Zapier saved me valuable time every single day updating my daily schedule with Clockify entries. Works perfectly. Great reporting capability. Overall, great. Clockify really helped and still helps me with managing my busy daily life. \u2014 Rafael S.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Exactly what I needed! It's super efficient to track tasks. I love how easy it is to organize my work with various different projects and clients, and being able to quickly hit \"stop\" and \"continue\" has made my time tracking much more accurate. I work highly irregular hours, so time tracking has always been a challenge for me. I tend to start, pause, and stop at random times and this makes it very difficult to estimate how much time I've actually spent working on something. Clockify has made this infinitely easier and so much more efficient. Thank you! \u2014 Katelyn", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

I love simple the software is to use. Normally when I start a new software I already want to leave because it's so complicated to use. this is as simple as it gets without losing functionality and I could use it straight away. I especially like that I could get most of the functionality that I needed to for free. I was so excited with my experience that I printed a report just to show my manager. She is now also interested in the software and is potentially looking to see how it could integrate in our work environment. Over all I am so grateful to beable to see what I'm doing with my day. I have 4 \"hats\" that I wear at work and sometimes I fee l like I dont get enough done. I also feel like I'm just wasting my time. Ever since using Clockify I can look back on my day and actually see everything I've accomplished. This motivates me to get more productive and I leave work feeling lighter rather than frustrated. I also love that I can integrate it with a lot of my favourite apps, although I haven't actually really used the integrations, but I'm also just starting out so that might change as I get more organised.

Keeping track of work across multiple different projects, some billed out to 3rd parties. Having a simple and easy to use way to record time spent and then where necessary produce billing reports was important. Had used previous tools before like Harvest but these were expensive and not as flexible. The visual reports really help to assess the best allocation of time and make adjustments on a weekly and monthly basis. \u2014 Dominique H.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Clockify helps us keep track of time!

It is for free, but when taking into account the features and design it offers, you wouldn't think so.

I was responsible for the social media side of an initiative, and that meant I had to create copy/respond to emails/be in communication with people all around my city. Clockify was able to work on my iPad (that I use for taking notes), desktop, and android phone - which allowed me to easily keep track of my hours no matter the time of day/place I was at. We needed a free utility for my timesheet, and it fit the bill perfectly.

Clockify is so easy to use and as an administrator, it's so simple and straightforward for me to view and report on our team's hours. There were a few bugs when we first signed up to use Clockify, but the response we got from support whenever we hit a snag was so helpful and involved. It only improved our experience! \u2014 Victoria B.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Look no further It's simple, it's intuitive, it tracks time like I need it (as a stopwatch and as a time sheet), I can edit entries (which is helpful when I get a phone call that takes me off track), the reporting is clean", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

It's fantastic. Clockify does exactly what I need it to in a simple and user-friendly format. I can track my time like a stopwatch, or enter my time after the fact. The reports pull in billable, and non-billable hours so I am confident when I bill my clients that I am presenting the most accurate information possible. It keeps me accountable and helps me feel confident that I have earned what I have earned and that I am worth the compensation. I worked in a large corporation where I had to track time for 10 years and never ever had something this straightforward. LOVE it. \u2014 Sarah F.S.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Just easy I found the tool so helpful in breaking up my time. I have always had problems time sheeting small tasks and jumping between clients. Within about a week of using clockify I was ontop of my time sheeting. \u2014 Shannon B.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Awesome Software for Project Planning Clockify has helped our business to hire new employees by determining the labor hours needed to transition tasks from one employee to the next. It also helps keep us accountable for time-sensitive tasks. \u2014 Ashley G.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Does what it says it will do! Simple to use and flexible enough to track time for multiple clients/projects/tasks. Good report graphics and data output (e.g. to input to invoicing software). Very easy to implement and setup. Installed and began using almost immediately. \u2014 Richard W.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Clockify has become a daily habit It literally takes just 2 clicks to start tracking my time when I begin my workday: open the desktop app and click a button. Clockify makes time tracking super easy. My clients are loving the detailed reports where they can see everything I've been up to. \u2014 Julia S.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Clockify Review Ease of use was the first thing I was looking for, and I found it. My company, Alexander Street Press, used a time system from another company. When the company was bought by ProQuest they discontinued the company-sponsored time system and left us on our own to find a substitute. One of the members of the Semantic database indexing team recommended Clockify, and about ten of us started to use it \u2014 Rossinna I.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Track, analyze and monitor your activities for better productivity.

Has most (if not all) of the functions on pricier and premium services. At the same time, it's the easiest to use on your current workflow. \u2014 Jose Manuel V.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Free but awesome! It's easy to use and has great free features. I really like this service, it gets the job done. I am in charge of keeping track of my own hours, I tried other free services but none fit the bill until Clockify! I use the free version and while other free services are extremely limited Clockify has awesome free features that really allows its users to get the job done. Clockify is limitless! \u2014 Bianca V.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 For free? What's not to love? I own a small, niche accounting firm with one employee three time zones away. And while most of my fees are fixed, we often take on \"projects\" for which we bill by the hour. Clockify lets my track our hours down to any \"sub level\" I need. It's perfect for me to track my admin time as well, so I know when it's getting close to me needing to hire an additional person. It's perfect for what I need. I use ClickUp (another great product) for task/project management. And, although it has an internal \"time clock\", it's weak. However, Clockify was one of the recommended integrations. It integrates perfectly with ClickUp and since it resides in clickup as well, we can start and stop it by task in ClickUp. Kinda remarkable. \u2014 Michael A.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Clockify is amazing Clockify is obviously the product of someone that wanted to do something right. Everything about it, from the user interface to the report generation and user management is done with an eye in making it stable and pleasant. Clockify is the perfect solution for our start-up. I could not ask for a better time tracking solution for our company. \u2014 Cantwell C.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Best software for tracking time worked! It is so easy to use and make corrections. It keeps track of time worked even if you forget to stop the clock. Time adjustments are so easy and you can print a report weekly or monthly. That's how I bill my client, so there's no haggling about the hours worked. It gives precise information about the time and hours you work. You can even label different projects as you work on them, so you can keep track of how much time is spent on each project. My client runs", "tokens": 1000, "node_type": "child"}

My client runs a small business. I have worked on various projects for her including data entry, marketing, uploading product photos and product descriptions, assisting her with managing her website, etc. I was able to track the time spent on each project by simply clocking in and out and using the labels. At the end of the month, she was amazed at how I was able to help her understand the breakdown of each project with the simple push of a button. \u2014 JoAnn P.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 It's awesome! I like that you can write the task you are working on. Then when you are working on a new task, you can easily start the clock again for that task. It is so easy to navigate and keep track of the tasks I'm working on. Plus, let's say that I want to change the task description, I can easily modify it. I love it!! I've been able to save a lot of time in invoicing clients because of the way I'm able to write the tasks in real time. That's the biggest benefit so far for me, the time saving aspect and ease of use. \u2014 Sheila Z.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Accurate Time-Keeping & Billing with Clockify Clockify is simple to use and is accurate. Before Clockify, I would underestimate how much time it would take to complete a project and under bill for it. With Clockify, I am able to accurately track my time and bill accordingly. Clockify has saved me and our business time and money! Clockify is a terrific timekeeping option to accurately account for billable time! \u2014 Jennifer T.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Perfect tool Ease of use for tracking time and reporting on time. Clockify is so easy to use! You can quickly and easily add clients, create projects, and track time. I also love the Chrome extension that makes it so easy and convenient to track time. \u2014 Julie S.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Can't ask for more from a free version I live the ease of use and the fact that you don't truly need to keep a tab open for it as it relies on cookies also to track time (i suppose).Adjusting tracked time is also easy. Straightforward . Took me a few minutes to set up and from there it's very easy to use all features including reports or any other edits you might need to do. Click click and done.

Not being forced to upgrade to Premium until your business reaches a certain level that requires or benefits from the perks of Premium is great. \u2014 Robert K.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Game Changer! Detailed downloadable reports to supply to my clients so they know how their money is being spent. Before Clockify, I had trouble accounting for time I spent working on client projects. Manual spreadsheets did not work for me. I like having Clockify right there on my desktop. This has been a game changer AND really a life changer for me. Thanks for what you do and for being independent. That's awesome. \u2014 Erin D.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Easiest way of tracking your working times The easy setup and the fast and non-complicated process of starting a new timer. My benefits are to track specific working times on projects. Also as a freelancer i am able to record my times and give them a number or title to manage them all. \u2014 Benjamin H.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Easy Interface for Any User Level We onboard new employees and interns quite frequently. There is no learning curve to this program and it is easy for us to get new people up and running, even ones who rarely use platforms outside of their normal routine. The tagging is very helpful in tracking various aspects of a project and helps when billing our clients. \u2014 Michelle F.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Clockify Does Everything I Need I love this software because it is so easy to use. I signed up and started using it immediately. I also love that the basic functions I need are covered in the FREE version, so I'm not costing my school extra precious funds. I wear multiple hats at work, which is common at a public education facility. Clockify helps me track my time between various duties. \u2014 Nancy M.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 The best free tool for freelancers It's is totally free of use, without advertisement. I have been using Clockify as a freelancer for 1 year now to track my different projects. I can easily export my tracking time at the end of the month. It's a great tool, nice UI and entirely free. \u2014 Etienne D.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Great time management platform I enjoy the robust time tracking features of Clockify which make it easier to monitor and track timed tasks for my students.

Clockfy allows an excellent integration between the web browser and the service. Also, it contains fields for tags, projects, client and paid tasks, which results in a flexible solution. \u2014 Uilian R.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 I can't afford to hire a personal assistant right now: Clockify has saved me! I NEED to be able to keep track of my time and would love to have a keen assistant constantly at my elbow ... but I can't afford that right now. What I love most about Clockify is that its interface is elegant, uncluttered and inviting, super-easy to use. This means that I actually DO keep track of my time and my projects. And almost unbelievably: it's free! Despite being definitely better and easier to use than some of the paid programs I tried out via free trials. As an independent researcher, artist, video-biographer and trainer, my life can easily get complicated. I am passionate about all of my projects, so that time management and good organization are essential if I am to continue to do what I love. With Clockify, I keep my projects organized, can add an delete as necessary. The super-important dimension of keeping track of my time is made easy thanks to Clockify's clear interface and intuitive functionality. The reports allow me to sit back and reflect on how well I am balancing priorities. \u2014 Sharon G.H.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Clockify is really useful The software is really easy to use, easy to set up, and includes all the features I need. Better yet, I get everything I need in the free plan! \u2014 Jason B.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Love this product! It's easy to edit, has nice UI & UX, is organized well. If I need to change the time I clocked in or out, it can be easily done. If I need to categorize what projects I'm working on, it is easily done. I love the time feature where you can input your time without the colon (ie 730 instead of 7:30). Love it! I work remotely and part-time so it's a great way to track my hours and projects I'm working on \u2014 Lulu A.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Exactly what I was looking for!

The free version of this software kicks butt - super easy to use and user-friendly, love the reporting capabilities. Helps me out a lot. The app is great as well. Have become better at understanding my time management, my hourly rates for different clients, and the average length of time spent on different projects, which has helped me with pricing structures. \u2014 Matt A.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 My love for Clockify I love the platform because of the ease of use and the fact that the interface is user-friendly. I have personally recommended Clockify to my clients and they love it too. The best part is that right on the dashboard for time tracking, I can easily select the client and project that I want to start or continue. As a Virtual Assistant, I do have clients that bill me by the hour and wants a breakdown of what I do on a daily basis and clockify has helped me create awesome reports for those clients. \u2014 Phylicia T.G.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Good work time tracker The most positive is the price - it's free to use with many features available. It's nice GUI, where it's easy to find what you need. I like it very well. When I have been searching for an toggl alternative, I found clockify and tested it. Since I have started using it, I'm very satisfied. It has many toggl paying features in its free variant, so I have most features that I need available for me. \u2014 Michal M.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 A very easy to use time tracker to cover many projects as a freelancer The interface is nice, the reports get me what I need for invoicing. I can tag any recorded time as billable or not billable and even enter the dollar amount. I tag entries for specific clients or types of work with various colors which helps differentiate entries. The weekly emailed report helps me make sure my time is on point. I previously used Toggl, which I like just fine, but was a bit limited on the free version, and I didn't like the interface that much. I tried Clockify just to see how it would go, and so far I like it and am sticking with it for the near future. \u2014\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 No strings attached Clockify is device-independent, cloud-based, flexible enough to accommodate all needs that a professional or a small", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

What I really like about it, though, is that it comes with no strings attached: all basic and intermediate features are free and have stayed free since I started using it some months ago. Premium functions are \"nice-to-have\" features that you may or may not subscribe to, without impacting your ability to take full profit of Clockify's basic and intermediate functions. Clockify's multiplatform nature means that you can access it from everywhere, so you really don't have excuses for lagging behind with your billing activities! Queries can be exported into an Excel file that you can use to generate invoices, streamlining the whole process. Plus, it is intuitive and easy to learn (no handbook required), so that freelancers can stay focused on their business, not on their billing software! \u2014 Andrea R.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Clockify is worth it The free version is fantastic! The reports and the functionality allow me to track my time as an executive! This time analysis is fantastic for allocating time into other areas. Time management has been number one through clockify! Couldn't recommend it more to do personal time analysis. \u2014 Mustafa W.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 What an excellent option and hidden treasure! Wow, where to start? First thing, we are extremely picky about how things looks like and in this case, with Clockify everything is well placed, designed and functioning, what about the interface? Amazing as well, intuitive and easy to use yet classic. \u2014 Arturo C.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 So Easy and Accurate! It is very easy to keep track of my hours on different projects, which makes it easy as an independent contractor to complete requests for payments and is a very efficient way to manage my projects. Adding or changing time retroactively is also very simple and quick. As an independent consultant, this helps me immensely to keep accurate track of my time on a variety of projects for different clients, then easily sort them out. \u2014 Cassandra S.F.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Easily the best free time tracking tool out there right now.

It represents exactly what I was looking for and needed for time tracking and also time management. This allows me to focus on my projects and tasks and not on the clock amd documentation. Exxcellent tool for working remotely, especially when working for multiple clients. \u2014 Joel S.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Straighforward time tracker Simplicity - It's a straightforward time tracking app that one actually uses. After trying different apps that I usually forgot to use regularly, or that offer too few or too many features I stumbled upon this app that is easy to use, offer just the features that you need (such as projects, analytics) and that are easy to use both through web browser and on the phone I finally managed to keep track of the time spent during the day over different projects. If you click on any task that you previously tracked it will start another tracking instance which is really beneficial for repetitive tasks and tasked stopped due to interruptions. As I work on multiple projects at the same time it is usually very difficult to pinpoint how time is spent during a regular working day. After starting using the app regularly i.e. having a tab regularly open and using Android app always when on the go (meetings, etc.) I got a clear picture of how time is spent and which projects are regularly taking \"invisible time\" ie. time that is not billed. After setting up basic projects and tagging each activity with a project I can get basic overview of how I am spending my time at a glance. I don't need to submit my time sheet to anyone, so I am not using the reports as much, but I see this as a very useful feature for freelancers. The user interface is simple and focuses on one single thing - and switching between the web app - tab in the browser and the app on the phone is without any problems. Another thing worth mentioning is integration with gmail - so each time I get something via email that will take more than 2 min to complete I could just click on the button within the gmail and start tracking time for that task - for me it meant really understanding how much all those \"little tasks\" actually take. In a way I also use this as a log for what I've done and to see if I am meeting the goals I set to myself such as 'spending more", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

It is great that it has a free plan as most time trackers don't. Being able to see daily and weekly timesheet is very helpful. You can use Clockify for basic time tracking or more complex working using projects. I wasn't tracking time before so didn't really know what I was spending on projects.

Reporting and team management are really easy and straightforward. Also, it is really fast compared to competitors.

Here, managing team (without size limit) is very easy, especially the ability to assign employee's hourly rate. \u2014 Marcin M.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Useful tool It is an easy to access and use tool to help organisations understand and track time from their employees and measure burn. Time tracking has been made easier at a system level and report highlights show where burn and overspend is occurring. \u2014 Ben M.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 A simple way to track your time I work for a small business so we do not necessarily need a huge piece of software for tracking our time and running billing like Harvest. I just needed a simple way to track my time on a couple different projects. Clockify is simple to set up, easy to use, and free at the level that I'm using it at. It's been great. \u2014 Lee L.K.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Clockify has simplified my timekeeping Clockify has democratized timekeeping for business. I've used a number of applications over the years to track my time on hourly-based projects, but they were complicated to use and didn't provide thorough enough reporting. Clockify has made setup and use simple, and I love the fact that it can live on my computer with access to my full account online with real-time reporting and tracking. The fact that it is free to use is the icing on the cake. As a solopreneur, I absolutely appreciate access to full-featured software without having to add yet another subscription, at least until I'm sure the software provides what I need. I'm completely sold on. It has made time tracking seamless, quick and easy in a way that other timekeeping options did not, particularly for my retainer clients who pre-pay for blocks of time. Clockify. \u2014 Jennae P.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Easily track and report on all your time So easy to use!

The chrome extension allows me to start my timer from emails and calendar events which is the most helpful option in my line of work. As a consultant, I'm switching gears as often as every 15 minutes and Clockify makes this possible and simple. I have to keep track of my billable time, which when you're billing by the 1/4 hour, that has the potential to be a lot of entries in a day. Before Clockify, I was hand-writing all my entries in a notebook which was both time consuming and often forgotten, leaving me to frantically try to recall what I did weeks earlier. Truly, Clockify has been my saving grace. \u2014 Nicole S.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Clockify Review 2021 Clockify has a very friendly user interface which makes it easy to use and pick up.

Overall it is a good experience with Clockify being that is a free-to-use software and very easy to learn. \u2014 Jian Hong L.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Working smarter than my colleagues Having to track your hours worked is a common chore for us software types. This makes it very easy. My clients are all internal so I don't use the billing features but I can see how this would make a freelancer's life much easier. Great app! Pros: That it's a web app. I work from several different workstations over the course of a week. I love that I can clocking my hours for a project at one location, go to another location, stop the clock and start it for a new task. The built in reporting features are wonderful. 90% of what you want as user and as an administrator and push button options and bam!

Making a new entry is very easy and also quick to make work more productive.Billing feature is useful here as you can set by default a billing price for your given time, each project is priced differently, set bill time to project and it will apply the charges in rates it has or the default . We can collect all generated data of reports. Charts provide a lucid view whereas tables enhances readability. Project sharing distributes work and makes work easier, this exactly is the means by which we can log time of our teams and are being able to decide if the time is billable or not. The filters work expected and searches are better. Our billing clients loved it and we too made achievable targets with clockify in position to make us responsible to time. It providds reliable form of tracking and now team can not make excuses for missing deadlines. Also we don't need much of knowledge about it's UI as most things are readymade. Though we can agree on a point that dashboard is not as simple as it should have been, which can definitely change the future course of clockify. \u2014 Triloky M.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Great product for all business! Clockify is easy to use and I love that it is free. For a new, small company like mine, it's been a huge help in keeping track of my hours/job. I highly recommend it!

Clockify is helping us to track the amount of time we spend working for every client and this allows us to understand better their profitability. \u2014 Francisco O.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Perfect time tracking tool for our small team We used Toggl in the past, though it became pricey for us. Depending on our current needs, we use free and premium version of Clockify and both are working very well for us. There is integration with our second tool - Asana - what makes time tracking a breeze. One more gamechanger for us was possibility to share time tracking report per project/client - perfect solution to allow clients to keep an eye on progress and costs. \u2014 Marcin B.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Great for small nonprofit Delivers everything we need at this point in our growth to keep track of time for grant fulfillment and analyze where our time is going - and it is free!

My organization was considering ClickTime which was going to cost us much more than we were wanting to pay and proved to not be near as user-friendly. My husband, who is a program and project manager, overheard our conversation and directed us to Clockify. Within less than a day's use of both, we quickly decided Clockify was the better choice for us. The flexibility of being able to use multiple devices that sync up was a big plus, too, especially for those of us that are off-site a lot. \u2014 Tracie S.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 One of the best time entry systemA solution that helped us manage our time and to optimize on what/where we spend our time when working with big teams. Its free, comprehensive, easy to access and use, easy to setup. And the best part is, its available on the cloud. \u2014 Tharini D.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Accessible online and simple We loved how simple and easily accessible it is. It helped our team to understand where we spend most our time. It helps us eliminated the wastage as our project as a time critical one. Highly satisfied!! \u2014 Dinesh S.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Really, no cons I am a digital marketing/demand gen agency of 1. I have a handful of clients with a handful of projects. It's great to track what to bill them and to let them know the time I already have into a project. Very easy to use. I like the option to track Clients, Projects AND tag things. It helps me figure out how long tasks are taking and is VERY easy to use when invoicing clients at the end of the month for their digital marketing. It's exactly set up how my brain works and what I need. \u2014 Melissa A.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Easy Time Keeping We use the free version of Clockify and it still has lots of features available for our needs! You can input the details of the task or project you are working on, as well as the client and input any relevant tags. You can then pull reporting based on all of these! I also like that you can edit the time because it is inevitable that I forget to start or stop my Clockify clock sometimes during certain projects. \u2014 Casandra C.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Great Product to Capture the Time Really intuitive product and easy understand it flow for the new user also, i liked the how time is running that you no need to keep the Tab open to keep running the Timer you can even close or logout once you done with your work can come back and stop the timer till that time timer will be keep running.

Time Rounding also lets me set a fair minimum rate, and makes payment easier for my employers. \u2014 Austin L.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Very useful and practical It's simple to just click a button and start to work. you don't need to retype stuff to organise your work. \u2014 Carlos M.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 An invaluable tool for a price you can't argue with Clockify is simple and easy to use, and importantly is also flexible. It's great that there are desktop and mobile applications, as well as the web application, so that you can track time in a way that is most convenient at the time. I often switch from logging my time as I complete a task and after I've completed tasks. The different ways of categorising time entries is also really useful, but for me one of the best features of Clockify is its ability to integrate with other web applications such as Trello and Google Docs - making it even easier to track time. The fact that an API is available is also brilliant. For me, Clockify has enabled me to improve my pricing structures by looking at how much I charge in comparison to the work I do currently versus what I would like that figure to be. It has also helped me to identify tasks that can either be optimised or made more efficient. \u2014 Andy G.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Great way to keep a record of your work It is a great software to keep your action in check. How much time you've worked you can keep track. And many times I used to stay longer in office just because I didn't remember for how long I have been there. But not I leave the office at right time so that I have have some \"Me time\". Overall it is great till now. I had suggested some points which are certainly of my use. Using Clockify has improved quality of my time. \u2014 Vishal S.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 May be the best time tracker there is!

My university capstone team was having trouble being productive and using all of its time wisely. Clockify gave us an easy way to track money, allowing us to keep each other accountable, and we have already made significantly more progress than we were before. It is easy to use, and has great reporting features to monitor each sub-team's hours. \u2014 Nathan T.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Fast and easy way to track time! It is very simple and easy to use and it works on the phone too. It has a very pretty dashboard to show statistics for myself and for the team. There are lots of useful categorization features. We are a startup so we work irregular hours so Jira has really helped us with time management and billing. \u2014 Chris Z.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Clockify is amazing I believe that the program is simply amazing! - It takes into account of the project and you can keep time down to the second - You can assign tags to the project and the thing your working on at the moment. Clockify keeps me honest on my time down to the minute. I no longer over or under estimate my hours on school work or projects. \u2014 Joseph C.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Works Great For Startups Clockify helped us track our employees and client hours. I love the ease of use that Clockify has to offer. We grew from a couple people to almost 80 and it worked perfectly for us the whole time! \u2014 Zachary G.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Very easy software to use I run a couple of agencies and Clockify allows my team and I to easily track and analyse how we spend our time and how we can become more efficient.

The reports are fantastic. Works everywhere I work across OS's, browsers, and apps. Clockify is one of my favorite apps. It is something I use and recommend every single day. I am definitely a Clockify enthusiast and am proud to have pushed for several integrations that are currently active. The team is very responsive and the development pace is excellent. They are also building a very nice community and share a lot of quality related content.

Clockify makes it very easy to track time, and also to set time budgets for projects. \u2014 Tony L.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Great Expanded Time Tracker Takes the simple functions of time sheet and timer and combines them into one, while adding multiple ways to almost automatically track metrics. Clockify helps me collect work hours data easily while informing me personally to improve productivity in more than just work! \u2014 Jeremy R.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 I really love this quick time-tracker for daily work It was super Easy and Fast to install on chrome just 1 minute and I was getting started. Love the fact that you don't have to download anything. Also very complete dashboard to keep track. Its been working great for me. We are trying to have some more control in how long tasks are taking and this its very helpful for it. \u2014 Fausto F.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Great value for an affordable price + constant development = successful software Pricing scales with features instead of scaling with the number of users. The development team clearly works very hard implementing new features and fixing bugs - Clockify is already much better than when I started using it! Great to track time in a small company. New features appearing every month or so are always pleasant news. Great and helpful customer support. \u2014 Maciej T.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 A great product You have got the product right and understand the market/needs well.

It also organizes projects, the client and you can easily stop the time tracker and come back where you left off without having to start all over again! So efficient for those work distractions! Benefits: Time-tracking is smoother; Productivity is easier to check back on; You can share progress with employer which is always needed. \u2014 Ellen M.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 A fantastic easy way to track time spent on clients' accounts The desktop app that sits in my task bar makes it incredibly easy to record time and then attach pdf reports to invoices. This has saved me a lot of time. I can just focus on getting the work done now and sending out invoices rather than having to manually itemise and record my time. \u2014 David J.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Great for software developers The design is clean and super intuitive. The Chrome extension works seamlessly. - Way cheaper then many alternatives that work on a pay per user basis. Great community support for migrating data from Toggl. - It's open source! \u2014 Trevi A.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Better value than most of the time trackers The best value for money you can get regarding the time trackers. I mean the features are maybe somewhat different, but it's not like we had any issue of switching to this. The transition to this was very easy. This allowed us to have everybody to track their time instead of us having to pay for extra users (which ends up costing exponentially more). Besides we didn't miss out on any features with regard to the competitors. At the end of the day you'd like people to track their time so it's easier for you to estimate, calculate or see where the time goes. And this allows that without having to pay an astronomically amount of money. If we need extra reporting features we will definitely be upgrading without having a hearth attack. Thank you for that. \u2014 Wahid N.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Control over project activities and goals It is very fast to use. I can input all my clients and projects.

On the website I can see the time reports per client, project, etc. The Mac app also detects if I'm not working and asks if it should keep or delete that time. It's perfect for me for freelancing, even on the free tier. I am helping myself to understand the time I take for doing stuff that I was not used before. Also, helps me to charge for my services. \u2014 Rodrigo E.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Works exactly like you'd hope, feature-rich, and has helped us realize profits It is extremely intuitive. It's very easy to create new projects, set them as billable and non-billable, and separate your time so you can easily see how you're spending your time and determine if projects are profitable. The reporting is easy to pull, has great filters, and pretty (colored pie charts!) The free version is extremely feature-rich which means we can get fully invested in this tool now, and as we grow we know it will grow with us. We've had an amazing experience with Clockify, it filled a very needed hole in our agency for reporting on our time in a standard way across all team members. We can easily see where our time has gone in real-time, and timesheets are easily send by just doing a simple export of reports. We recommend it to every single business owner or entrepreneur we meet. \u2014 Torre C.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Clockify Increases Productivity What I like most about Clockify is the ease of use.

I appreciate the multi-faceted organization of having clients, projects, tasks, tags, etc. It's easy to understand and allows for flexibility within the product setup. Additionally, the easy to access reports allow for quick review of time tracking data without having to export to another format. I started utilizing Clockify to add some clarity to the work of my company's small 3-person UX team. We wanted more insight into how we were utilizing our time. We work across products so we set up each product as a client, each project as a project within the client, and then create tasks to determine how much time we spent on design, research, meetings, etc. per project. Additionally, we've added tags for greater specificity within some of those tasks. This allows us to see a wide variety of information such as how many projects we've worked on in a given period, how long we spent in meetings vs. designing during a certain quarter, which products demand the most of our attention, etc. \u2014 Graciela B.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Clockify Review I enjoy using clockify because it allows me to track the time I spend on working for my clients.

I'm working on daily basis for at least 4 different clients and it's easy to manage time for all of them. If client asks for timesheet, I can easily generate clockify report for them. If I need to put fixed hours, clockify gives ability to do so. Overall experience with clockify I rate as 8.5/10. It's a must dev time logging tool. Even if your client doesn't tell you to log your time, it helps yourself to begin proper time management and see how much time you've spent on specific tasks. \u2014 Damian N.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 My Overall Experience As an end-user who uses this software every day, I'd say it's pretty simple to use and makes time tracking easy. My company decided to replace our previous time tracking software with Clockify just over two years ago and it didn't take long before the rest of the employees began using it. Credit should be given to its easy UI compared to the previous software we used which looked complicated and took some training. So overall I'd recommend this to business owners looking to make time tracking easy for their employees and themselves. Clockify makes it easier for folks at the company I work for and myself to generate a timesheet report for any specific period. Normally payroll would ask us for a monthly time report before they pay us so this comes in handy plus it's very simple to generate with just a few clicks. \u2014 Chavez H.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Straightforward Time Tracking Software -- Easy to Learn, Easier to Use There are two features that really stand out when it comes to Clockify.

The first being its compatibility across a number of devices. I can track my time via the web app or desktop app while working from my home office, then just as easily use the mobile app to record how long I've spent working on my train ride into the city, all without having to worry about issues with syncing between my devices. The second feature that I absolutely love about Clockify is how granular it allows you to be when tracking your activities. You have complete control with the ability to create clients, assign projects to those clients, and even generate tasks within each project. And when it's time to use the tracker, just pick which project you want to track from the drop-down. The projects are separated by clients with submenus for each project displaying that project's tasks. You even have the option to add further description in the 'What are you working on?' field. This level of detail is critical when it comes to recording my time for invoicing purposes. On the other hand, if you need to just record the time and fill in the details later - you can do that too! As a software developer working on small projects while putting myself through school, I have to be very careful with how I manage my time. Clockify provides me with a great solution to keep myself accountable for my waking hours. With its feature to add clients, I'm able to record the time I spend studying separately from my work hours by listing my education institution under one client and my contracts under their own respective clients. The reporting feature is insightful in breaking down my time by my desired filters (date, client, project, task, etc.). It enables me to keep my clients happy with accurate progress reports and estimated completion dates as well as help me gauge my progress in my school's curriculum. Tracking my time using Clockify has definitely kept my life on track! \u2014 Meghan G.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 So easy to use I didn't have to see any tutorial I loved the UX and design it's so easy to use that I didn't need any tutorial.

It tracks project progress and allows us to make schedules and make sure our teams are on track, and also allows us to tabulate billable hours. It's easy to use, and everyone is happy with the user interface. You can choose billable vs nonbillable hours, and it makes our payment system so much less of a headache. All in all a wonderful tracking and billing tool which keeps us on top of our project goals while also making it a breeze to track billable hours for payment. \u2014 Victor M.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Best time tracker software I've ever used It's so easy to use! You can start tracking time before you've entered the task, it collates all time for each task per day so you don't have a list of 10 time entries for the same task, it's clear and easy to see how much time you've spent on each task and every day - I love it! I've tried quite a few time tracking options over the years, free and paid, and Clockify beats them all hands down. \u2014 Ruth D.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 One world simple and time saver I was spending ages in creating monthly reports for my clients and the billing moment was becoming a stressful operation. We are consultancy company and selling time is our core. 1 year ago I found Clockify and almost all the issues disapperaed. I suggested it to my partners and clients. I really liked immediately the way I could setup projects and cost centers and how to deal with team management. \u2014 Antonio L.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 A Fantastic Software with Great User Interface Design Clockify is hands-down the easiest software I've ever used to track my time.

Clockify is the only software where I understand where I input my time while also being able to leave detailed notes on what I was working on at the same time. The website loads seamlessly on my computer and it only takes me a few seconds to input my time, which is exactly what a great software should do. \u2014 Juliette R.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Clockify for a team of 3 Designers I really like how intuitive the desktop version is. Plus its very extensive. We've been using different tracking-programms before, but most of them were missing one thing or just too complicated to find out the overall hours when writing the bills. And the fact that it is web-based allows us to track time even when you have to work from abroad. Overall clockify is the best tracking tool we've been using so far an i think it will be our choice in the future. \u2014 David E.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Easy to understand and use I currently use clockify to log my hours spent doing any tasks related to a unit that I study in university. The ease of use makes it ideal as it is a simple start and stop function that logs my hours. The user interface is easy to understand and use and it is also aesthetic in its appearance. Adding an activity or project as well as adding timeslots manually or through a timer are made to be easily used. \u2014 Ivan C.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Good overall, absolutely the best alternative As a consultant it is important to keep track of the time I spend with customers. Clockify makes it easy for me to track it no matter if I'm on the move or at the office. It is quite easy to use and saves all my tracked time. It makes it easy to get an overview of my work. \u2014 Simon N.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Wonderful for tracking productivity The ease of use and the ability to quickly examine your personal data to recognize areas where you are spending the most time which in return allows you to create a targeted strategy to reduce that time. I mean I enjoy it so much I use outside of work to track my own personal self-development. \u2014 Jessup S.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Great option for tracking time spent on various work streams Deployment was a breeze, documentation on their website is excellent, and customer service has been good.

Most importantly - it's easy for team members to track their time, and the chrome extension means they don't even have to open a new tab to start/end a tracking session. Also, it was easy to deploy and the cost is low. \u2014 Andrew K.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Our team got used to Clockify the very first hour Clockify helped us land more sales because we were able to offer our clients insights into the work they are paying for. We needed an app that will let our employees track their time spent on a project easily, and this was the perfect choice. Why? Our employees, who had no prior experience with time tracking software, were able to use Clockify's full features without hustle. The app gives user the full control over projects and time spent on each project, as well as tasks related to specific project. \u2014 Anis A.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Multifunctional time tracker Easy of use, mobile platform, gives you an option to doublecheck you working time and to know about an extra time spend. Allows to control timing on the projects or any personal tasks. Like the simplicity and intuitivity, when i work on multiple tasks it gives sense of some control on them. \u2014 Ilia D.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Our timeekeeper of choice I like this software because it is easy and fast! i can copy and paste the same entries and this is key for me being in IT.

Since Clockify provided an equal set of features and functionalities, but is free, it suited us very well (as a startup with limited resources). That said, we're considering the paid plan, given it is very affordable, adds more features, and supports the maintenance and further development of Clockify. Given it's a free tool there's nothing to complain about - the feature set is very rich Just worth pointing out Clockify is a manual time tracking tool (different to other tools that track our usage in the background). \u2014 Andy B.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 When users create something for themselves, the outcome is awesome It has all the features one can look for,We were paying heaps every month and now we have more features..free!

I now can track my time down to 5 minute intervals, and when managing a full kitchen it is integral to know where your time goes. At first, using Clockify is a chore - remembering to use it is hard, until it becomes second nature and you start appreciating the resolution to which you can track your time. Clockify helped me keep track of all the time I spend on management duties. It helps me see how much of my time goes towards managing the kitchen, and how much goes towards managing people. Working in a large group, a lot of my time was spent micromanaging people who should have been left to their own devices, and Clockify helped me see that. I am now much more in control of my own time, and that makes me more efficient. \u2014 Mihael H.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Great tool Easy to use easy to track time and get paid,Great tool to track time and get paid. \u2014 Francesca L.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 The Best & Free Time Tracking Application We have been using this app for a long time now after having a bad experience with our own developed simple time tracking app for our team and some of the freelancers working with us on an hourly basis. But then we found it and from that, we are using it now. It's Free, It's unlimited and you can use it on multiple devices.Our overall experience is very good so far.

As a freelancer, i have different pay rates for different kinds of projects, so it is great to be able to have them organised in Clockify. It's great that there is a desktop app and also the option to add time manually to a project. I'm enjoying Clockify and will keep using it in the hope that the Windows desktop app will be updated soon with the upcoming features. If not, i may need to look elsewhere, as it is a vital feature for me. However, all up it has been a positive experience. \u2014 Alicia B.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Great Free Tool for Tracking Time Overall I've been loving my experience with Clockify. It's simple yet versatile and serves my needs. I generally charge my clients a flat fee per project or per month. One day I realized tracking the time spent per client or project might be a good idea. Then, I can see if the rate seems fair, or if certain tasks are taking longer than seems reasonable.

Being able to pause the timer to take a break and then resume the timer on the same task is very convenient. Clockify will keep track of the total time worked. If you need to, you can drill down to see the start and stop times for each session. The reporting feature lets you choose from several common time intervals (this week, past two weeks, last month, etc.); but they also give you the flexibility to choose a custom range from a specific date to a specific date. \u2014 Danielle N.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Makes my job so much easier! It took me all but 5 minutes to figure out! Very simple to use! I use it everyday to keep track of my hours from multiple clients, tasks, and projects. Being able to print out a report in less than 5 minutes based on the client has made my job more efficient.

You can make it as robust as you'd like by adding tags, projects, and tasks, but you can also keep it super simple with just time tracking. You can easily choose to grant access to clients, use it as a solopreneur or expand to include a full team. I've tried several project management and freelance all-in-one solutions, and the ones that excel in most areas completely flop in timetracking, so i use Clockify to fill that gap, and then easily attach my timesheets or reports to invoices in other software. \u2014 Kim H.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Simplicity rules It's so simple and easy to use, I've been using it for about a week and I've enjoyed its simple UI and intuitive design. \u2014 Simon B.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Great way to track project times Most of the time tracking software i have used is so complex it is easier to not use it and go back to paper. i love that it has a box where you can just start a project and hit enter. that the only thing you can do is this. i love that there is a free plan that", "tokens": 1000, "node_type": "child"}

I can't believe it. \u2014 Ollie Y.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Simple, Feature Rich, and Clean We needed to track internal time comitted to a large multi-month project. This gave us the ability to easily have users log time, attach to specific portions of the project, and have easy month-end reporting. It was a very simple setup, easily integrate into a Teams page, and feature-rich with the reporting we wanted. \u2014 Andrew C.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Absolutely brilliant! I've been using this software for about a year now. I was previously on a freelance platform that offered an hourly option, but for various reasons I don't use it anymore. Most of my clients are fixed rate, but I have a few who prefer to pay by the hour. I didn't quite know what I was getting into with Clockify but I LOVE it! You can customize an hourly rate by project, categorize projects under larger projects, etc. The stats features are great, too. You can customize the timesheet you send to clients, and automatically save it as a pdf file which is great - PayPal will not accept Excel. Overall, I'm highly satisfied with Clockify. I recommend it to my other freelance colleagues, and will continue to do so. I'd recommend this to any freelancer out there who wants a reliable, quick and easy way to track time. \u2014 Shana T.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Very easy and useful Very easy to add project and keep control on time spend on every job.Various reports possible for record.

My company uses Clockify and it's been helpful to automatically submit my hours and projects with specific description/team without having to take any extra steps. \u2014 Jane P.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Seamless time tracking Clockify is so easy to use and intuitive. The learning curve to master the platform is almost none. From the first time I used it, it's like you just know what to do with it. You can easily click on the time and update it if you forgot to start the clock when you started the task. You can manually input time or use the auto-tracker. You can put in the description of your task without hassle. I love it! It has saved me so much time when it comes to billing my hours because I can categorize tasks and color code them. The ability to run reports based on client, task, or category saves me a lot of time during billing because I am able to see how much time I spent on certain categories. For example, I charge a client X amount for consultancy hours and Y amount for training hours. So I have a consulting and a training category. Clockify allows me to run a different report for each so I can see how many hours of each category. The app has been really helpful in being able to track my time while out in the field. It's great! \u2014 Sheila Z.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 A necessity for any freelancer Clockify is extremely useful and functional. As a freelancer, I can create multiple workspaces for the different clients I work with, and keep an organized and accurate history of my time spent on projects. Clockify enables me to keep an accurate log of the time spent on projects for respective clients. I can easily download logs and include them when I invoice clients. \u2014 Pamela L.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Immensely helpful Clockify allows us to track our employees time and run reports for billing and reporting to outside entities with ease. It was easy to train our employees on and we've had minimal issues since we've started using the program. I'm still amazed that this software is free. We are happy with the software and it has helped us immensely in the tracking of our activities and in creating reports for billing. \u2014 Katey H.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Great Interface with an excellent mix of form and function!

Plus it is very easy to administer and use. The plugins in Jira works fantastic with chrome and Firefox. Easy to use. Quick to manoeuvre. Excellent reporting and administration. \u2014 Anurag K.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 User-friendly Time Tracker Clockify is user-friendly and very easy to navigate. I never experience any downtime within the past 2 years that I used it. The paid features are fabulous if you are managing a team. Timing and being able to scrub time entries as necessary is also simple. I am super satisfied with it's simplicity yet gives me an overview of the complexity of my team's agenda and tasks done. It gives me peace of mind that they are working on the project and how much time they spend on each project. \u2014 Kathleen G.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Conveniant time-tracking tool with powerful free-tier Clockify allows me to keep a general log of my activities throughout the working day and help me bill and plan more realistically. Pros: Easy to use, both for new users and power-users (not very repetitive, simple manual entry options) Reliable; never had a clock go wrong or a session disappear. The free-tier doesn't omit essential tools, which was crucial in getting me on-board. Editing time-entries is easy, clear and efficient. \u2014 Ralph K.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Ease and convenience in one I've used Clockify before and I find it very convenient and easy to use. I can easily continue tracking the same project in just a press of a button. Team management and designation of tasks is very easy and the interface is user-friendly. I would recommend Clockify to freelancers like me. User-friendly easy interface easy management of projects and team members convenient access and tracking of work hours easy setup \u2014 Charlemagne B.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 I've been using the free version for about 6 months now, and it's great!

It's definitely a good choice for me for tracking my work times. The software is intuitive, the user interface is easy to understand and it has everything I need as a freelancer who needs to track hours for my employer. I send my employer a link to my 'Report' once and they can view it anytime. I also like that there is an option to start a timer for tracking, or to manually put in the times I've worked. I also especially liked how the software automatically groups items that have the same name (i.e. if I do work A at two separate times of the day, Clockify automatically groups them together). It helps make the UI look a lot cleaner and organized. \u2014 Angela Joi C.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 So helpful It's easy to use, and very convenient.

Well, it's free, which is great. But, that would be worthless if it didn't do the job we needed. We use this for managing our team of 10 and it works great. I can create custom reports and group employees by type, location, project, etc. You would not expect this product to be supported since it's free, but they do, which is fantastic. Really good. First and foremost, it works. There have been no development bugs or situations that made me want to leave. As I mentioned, I have a few suggestions, but overall this is a TREMENDOUS value for the price. \u2014 Patrick C.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Helped me fix working overtime I work part-time as an Administrative Assistant and was working well over my weekly paid time. Clockify has helped me to fix that and track my working hours, and overtime, as well as track the amount of time that I spend on certain pending projects. I like the ability to categorize by project. This saves me so much time at the end of the week tracking the progress of my projects. It also helps me to visualize when it is time to wrap it up and move onto another pending project. \u2014 Jennifer S.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Clockify is awesome Clockify is so easy to use and does everything i need it to. \u2014", "tokens": 1000, "node_type": "child"}

The Time tracking features are great, especially for businesses with 3 or more employees. Charts graphs overtime tracking, and tons more. It was just a 7-day trial, it was enough time for me to know it had too many features for me. Businesses that are larger and paying hourly will find this to be an essential time tracking tool. For companies that have projects and teams will find Clockify to be the best for them. I have recommended it to friends, small business owners, and they have found it to be perfect for their needs. It is worth a look and trial, you won't regret it. \u2014 Chris B.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 So fast to use Easy to see what's going on, quick daily use, functional export. Far and away the simplest way I've ever had of logging my time for freelance work. And the set up process is a non event! Glorious. \u2014 Duncan C.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Great solution for billing and project planning Our team works remotely and is currently in a time of great growth and transition. Clockify is helping us stay on top of the various projects and team members, allowing new faces to get up to speed and upper management to be easily informed on how our time is being spent. Middle management can readily see the time spent by their team members and help optimize the team's flow. Level of detail in time tracking allows for a broad or a more granular look at your projects Web app and mobile app options both intuitive Informative reports even in the free version. \u2014 Ian A.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Best time management and productivity tool I like how much this one gives out for free. Everything is synced automatically all over. So if you change on the website, it updates, the mobile app, the chrome plugin. It is very user-friendly and I use it daily. After looking around other softwares, I find this one better. I moved around Toggl, HoursTracker, etc and still find this one the best. You can have teams too for free, and unlimited projects for free. Set them to be billed or not, customize times and dates you worked or just set it on the go. It is awesome. I love it to say the least and I am glad I can contribute to others learning and getting it as well to try it out.

I like the fact that you can easily add and adjust the time spent on a project. It works really well for us to be able to allocate time spent on a client, which in the end helps us with our billing procedure at the end of the month. Overall Clockify has made it easier for our company to keep track of what we are doing and it has made our billing at month end more accurate. \u2014 Deolene B.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 good software for a painful task I would like to say up front that I hate time logging. I find it to be a pain and hard to do. With that said, clockify helps to take some of that pain away. the software is more modern than the product we switched from, and is much faster. THe front end client is lightweight and easy to use. Although time logging is tedious, Clockify does a good job of mitigating that in an easy to use product. \u2014 Mark B.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Finally something free! I'm so grateful to have found time tracking software that does basic functions for free. What a rip off with other companies. It's very intuitive and the reports give me the information I need to process payroll quickly for 10 employees. We have been able to move away from 3+ forms of time tracking to one, in the cloud, timely, and FREE. We really needed this but couldn't justify paying so much for it. Thank you Clockify team!! \u2014 Jenny R.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Fantastic Software for Small Businesses The free package has all the features that we need to track time for all of our staff, interns, and tasks. We are more than happy with detailed reporting and tracking methods. We have been looking for a timesheet system that all of our staff will use. A system is only as good if it is used. Previously using excel spreadsheets with 50% buy in. Now we are 100 percent buy and and regular use by all of our 7 staff. \u2014 Kurt N.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 The best intuitive tool for time tracking The ease of use is unparalleled among other similar apps that I've used. The number of clicks to start, create, label, and stop an event are kept to a minimum which is great for a user who tracks many different activities each day.

I love the ability to set a bunch of different lables/categories up the first few uses and easily search and bookmark them for future use. Lots of the tasks that I am tracking fall into the same categories on a daily basis, so it's important to have these easily accessible when marking a task. Every time I switch tasks, I can easily end the current with one click and start the next one, name it, and categorize it in just 3 clicks. The reports are also very nice and clear, breaking down time usage in an easy to visualize format that makes spotting trends over weeks very easy. \u2014 Alexander W.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Clockify has saved me money and made me money Since I have multiple franchises that we service, being able to have the team clock in under each franchise for the time they spent for that area, and running the report to show the client how he was receiving his appointments (we do appointment setting call center services) at a ratio far better than what he expected was profitable to me, it also helped me with being able to bill the correct amount to each client with no disputes or questions. It helped me show the franchises how are appointments per time on project was higher than he had anticipated which encouraged more clients to contract us. I have referred fellow business owners that have remote workers to use Clockify it is easy to use and has a break down of almost everything I could think of. \u2014 Michelle N.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 One Of The Best Time Tracking Softwares The app is incredibly easy to use and it is easily integrated into my workflow. You are able to customise a lot of different options and the software works well on multiple different platforms. Overall, Clockify is really easy to use and it is really intuitive and easily implemented. The great thing about the software is that it is free for unlimited users and the free version has a lot of great features. \u2014 Matthew K.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Finally, a simple and easy-to-use time tracker I've tried almost every time tracker out there, and Clockify is by far my favorite. It lets me set different workspaces and keep everything neatly organized without wasting time wondering what's what. I can easily create a project, add the tasks I need to complete, add a tag or note for the specific task I'm tracking, and start the timer. Even when the timer is running and it sits next to my working document, it never distracts me with intense colors or moving elements that I've found annoying in", "tokens": 1000, "node_type": "child"}

The best thing I love about it, though, is how easy I can filter through the reports. This is invaluable, especially when you want to keep an eye on how much something is taking you, so you know how much time to allocate for a similar task in the future. I use Clockify internally, so I don't use the team or client specific features, but it's all readily accessible so it's always there if and when I need to access those features. The other major pro for me is that it's not a software that forces you into an upgrade or limits the features you can use if you're on the free plan. That is something I value a lot as a marketer and user, so if my needs grow beyond using it for my own projects, I wouldn't think twice about supporting Clockify over other options. Clockify took away one of my biggest headaches: having a time-tracking tool that's not intrusive in any way but one that's flexible, simple, easy to navigate and - most importantly - get a sense of how much time you spend on a task every week. \u2014 Ralitsa M.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Easy way to keep track of time by task or project The extension on your web-browser and the way the software integrates with basecamp and other applications makes it easy to track time by task. \u2014 Dee W.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Clockify is a game-changer I love Clockify! I was struggling with keeping track of work time for each client, and HOW I spent that time. Now I can log the specific task, project, client, and time worked super easily. And then I can run reports at the end of the month for billing purposes. If a client wants to know my time breakdown, I've got a report for that! It's a wonderful free way to keep track of time and projects for the work I do for each of my several clients. I'd gotten advice from my peers that Clockify was great and you get tons of great features for free. Since starting to use Clockify, I won't switch. It's intuitive so I didn't have to spend a lot of unpaid time trying to learn yet another app. \u2014 Erin C.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Software review I like that the software is very easy to use.

We have many remote persons and also are audited as a company when project complete. Clockify makes it easy for use to build a paper trail of hours worked and is very useful when invoicing or computing cost of development for various features in the pipe. We use many online tools to collaborate and plan. Clockify has supported 90% of them through the Chrome extension. \u2014 Colin N.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Good value for money We had to switch from our previous internal built in system for logging hours in a big hurry. At first we were hesitant to have a special tool besides PM system but after a week and just one easy tutorial no employee had trouble using it, understanding it and it did not consume more time than our previous system. \u2014 Lucia S.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 A game-changer for tracking remote work There are two big pros to using Clockify as opposed to other apps. The first is that I can track on my phone--a few taps and I'm ready to get onto my work--but when doing my invoicing, I can pull the information up on my web browser and see the big picture. The second is being able to categorize my work by both client and project--I can then see later how much time I've spent on x or y, and figure out how to become more efficient or based on hours paid out, justify a software upgrade to save me time. Thanks, Clockify! \u2014 Kerri M.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 A real lifesaver I discovered Clockify some time ago when a client wanted to see if there were any time tracking pieces of software he could use. I didn't use it then, but when our time tracking software turned into a frustrating mess of lost time entries, slow loading, and mis-calculated weekly times, I gave it a shot. Best decision I ever made for our team.

I can work with multiple clients with a different dashboard for each client and can tag the project name for the time I worked and also tag it as billable or non-billable. These features have helped me much as I can work for multiple clients with proper time management and tracking so that I can efficiently manage my workloads. Also, I use its chrome extension so that I can start/stop the timer from the extension itself and write notes for the time interval. Also, it allows me to generate reports summary, detailed, weekly, or with custom date interval and also allows to share the reports in different formats. It's easy to use with a good user interface and best time tracking software as I searched and switched from one to another until i found Clockify. \u2014 Pawan P.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Totally recommended For years that we tried to get a full hour report from the entire team, but only with clockify we could get it done with sucess.

Between mobile, chrome extension, and desktop versions, Clockify is accessible for whatever I'm doing. The widget pops up on programs like Gmail and Notion to quickly capture time for a project. I'm surprised by all the places I see it. Tracking and reporting is super easy. Clockify is so much better than the excel spreadsheet I started with, and it will grow with my business. I switched from my initial Excel spreadsheet to save time and make reporting easier. As a fixed-rate freelancer I need to track hours for entrepreneur tax deductions in the Netherlands. Clockify meets all the requirements for reporting and metrics I need to track...and it's free! \u2014 Nicole J.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 The time tracking software you want and need The ease of use and detailed reports make Clockify shine above the rest for time tracking software!

There is so much more to this software that I haven't even tapped into yet. One would be the Geographic logging in feature... Well, my overall experience would be that I'm totally satisfied and would purchase again if I had to. Give them a try. This software is definitely moving you into the digital age which is fantastic. My employees love it because it's so simple and doesn't take up their time clocking in and out by logging into a system. \u2014 Jay G.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 A simple yet great time tracker I started using Clockify at the beginning of last year to start tracking time when working on development for a company we had a contract with. Once the contract was over, I kept on using Clockify, just because it is a great way to manage your time and make sure you stay on track (or at least track how much you didn't). I love that now I know what I used to spend my time on without even realizing and I could make corrections to make myself more productive. It is non-intrusive. The UI is clean and simple and it does not distract from its primary function - to track time. Don't get me wrong, there are many time tracking options available in Clockify, from actual costs to advanced reports and timesheets, but the basic UI is very easy to navigate and it does not make you go through hoops just to track your time. \u2014 Antonio M.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 The best way to time your work hours We had previously used the Pomodoro methodology, but it became ineffective after a while because its real goal was lost. With clockify we were able to measure time, pass hours consumption report to our customers, thanks to the project filter, and this was the most valuable feature of the software. It's simple, the tool works with trello, and we don't need another tool to make our reports. \u2014 Grazielle C.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Fantastic work/project tracking software Beautiful and clean design which allows customers to easily track hours for their work or project.

My favorite thing is that I can start/stop multiple times and they will add up up to a total of hours for the day where as other tools I have utilized like this one make you manually add the time up. The layout is beautiful and easy to navigate as well. \u2014 Aniyah M.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Modern & easy to use! Clockify is the best website I've come across for tracking my hours of work online. I would honestly pay for this app with all of its features and easy-to-use software, and can't believe it is free. With just a click of the mouse, you can start and stop your time. You can also categorize your different hours, making it extremely easy to be organized with more than one job. My overall experience with Clockify so far has been great, I am so glad I chose this hour tracking software compared to others I probably would've had to pay for. \u2014 Ali W.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Simply perfect Clockyfy is very easy to use, my team always had a certain blockage for this type of software use but with Clockfy I had no problem. Your reports and your management helps a lot to keep track of the team's work. Your API is very good and we also use it. Everyone I indicated tested and put it to use in their companies. Its use is very practical and substantially beneficial. We use it daily and do not dispense this tool anymore. \u2014 Thyago S.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Awesome app I like Clockify because it has great features, and also great graphic.

It is super simple and user friendly. \u2014 Cecilia T.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Best time tracking app we've found The simple interface makes it really quick and easy to track and record time. The reports are very useful and assist with costing out jobs at the end of each month, especially as you can assign hourly rates. Allows us to easily attribute time to projects, by client and also the ability to add bespoke tags is useful too. If a company needs to measure profitability, the option to log time as billable or not billable makes reporting this a dream. We haven't had to use customer support as we haven't experienced any long term issues. We're now able to identify ways in which to improve profitability for the company. Has increased the accuracy of time being tracked, as well as encouraging team members to track who were previously poor at doing so. \u2014 Sharon W.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Best time tracking app out there I most love how easy this app is able to integrate into my workflow. It literally only takes me a few clicks to switch gears to a different project. So when a customer calls up and I need to start tracking my time differently, I can switch my time to a new task (before I even know what the task is) and once the customer fills me in on the needs of the call, I can start to detail the clock that is still running, without interrupting anything. Overall, Clockify has helped streamline my small business. I no longer have to worry about keeping timestamps in my head while picking up the phone, or jotting a quick note down that I'll forget what it's in reference to later. Clockify has made me more efficient, and more accurate, two things that are wonderfully customer-centric. \u2014 Joel B.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Easy synced time logging I love the fact that my time logged across all my devices in the could. i don't have to worry about \u2014 Reggie L.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Excellent for labor-based pricing Clockify makes it really easy for me to time my labor on various projects.

Because Clockify lets me track multiple clients and projects, it works perfectly for my use case. \u2014 Patrick T.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Best app for tracking your time, it does what you need exactly The ease of tracking time on multiple tasks and switching between them, whether I'm in front of my computer or on my phone. i also love that i can just start a timer without needing to fill in the required fields. Sometimes i just need to switch gears because a customer has called me, and i don't know what i'm going to be tracking exactly, the ability to fill it in on the fly after already starting the timer is a real winner. i have been able to increase my efficiency when multi-tasking tremendously. With the ability to add in a quick note an associated project, i am quickly doing what i should be, working. \u2014 Joel B.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Quickest, easiest way to track my project time The top thing that i like about Clockify was how easy it was to get started. The second thing that i really enjoy was that it was easy to fix the early mistakes that i made in how i used it from the beginning. i was looking for something to easily track the time i spend on projects that were assigned to me. Most products I've tried take too much time to setup and too much time to maintain. Clockify hits the prefect balance between flexibility and setup/maintainability that it's something i can see myself using long term. At this point I've been using it for a month. \u2014 Ryan H.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Wow, I cannot believe the amount of functionality is included in the free version The UX is great, it's very easy to use, and is very feature-rich.

An amazing find! \u2014 Toyia W.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Surprising Time Tracker for Individuals and Teams Very clean and minimalistic look that makes time magement a breeze. You can have it working on a browser tab or download it as a desktop version and in seconds (really, in seconds) start recording how much time is spent on whatever your working. It's main focus is on multitasking, when you jump from project to project, and when knowing how much time you dedicated to all your work and chores. Now I understad why so many big companies are choosing Clockify for time management for individuals or teams. I had mu first time tracker in seconds (mainly after watching the intro video, very recomended so you don't waste time pushing buttons). In half a day I already had five different time trackers, acknowledging just how multitasking I can be. Give it a try, I started today just wanting to get back tracking time of whatever I could find. \u2014 Edgar R.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Easy to use tool for", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

Clockify was the prefect solution. I love that I can have multiple projects running at the same time, and each one is individualized and kept separately. Its lovely piece of software for a starting business. Time keeping was a huge issue for me! I work on custom pieces of Athletic wear and changer per hour. However most of these projects are multi-day projects and require pauses along the way. It is great to have something that tracks the time for you! and not only that but also gives you an idea of your hourly cost which is a great way of avoiding unexpected surprises to the customers since your cost estimates are directly estimated. I use these estimates to let me customers know ahead of time if budget changes along the way. \u2014 Alejandra S.F.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Simple and very effective time recording Clockify does exactly what you expect from software to easily capture time records on activities. It also has a high rate of incorporation of new functionalities. We are using Clockify for the time recording of a large support team and although, for now, it requires a manual process to incorporate tasks, it is being very useful to know the evolution of the activity. \u2014 Gonzalo M.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Nice and easy timetracking software Freelancers most likely are paid hourly so they need to count the hours. Even not freelancer may want to see how and where they spend their time. I used to use it when I was a freelancer and recommended to my current company. The free plan is kinda generous and better than the one in toggl, it has the \"billable hour\" feature for free where in toggl it is paid. \u2014 Nicolo P.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Love!

I thought that there would be a learning curve, but there wasn't! It was so intuitive and easy to understand that I just started using it and it has changed my world. I'm not making notes on paper or trying to remember what I did or when I changed projects. I keep the Clockify tab on my browser and every time I change projects I just go to the Clockify tab first, stop one project and start or restart the next. I used to hate tracking my time, now it's FUN! I really HATED tracking my time before Clockify and now I LOVE it! It's made me more efficient because I know, for sure, how much time I'm spending on each of my work projects.

I found the software and jumped straight into it with tracking hours for clients and their individual projects. The reports are nicely laid out and easy to read and navigate. Having the option to track billable vs non-billable hours is also a bonus. You can easily see where your time is going in a day, week, or even year. \u2014 Sara T.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Clockify has made my life easier and saves me time Clockify is the best time-recording software I have come across. I can easily record what I'm spending my time doing, either by recording it in real-time or after the fact.

I've always had problems with estimating and Clockify seems to be helping me understand the time that goes into my work. \u2014 Cameron B.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Excellent and simple way to record time I work on both customer support projects (answering questions, debugging, investigations, training) as well as development projects (my main role is in the R&D department). Clockify is extremely helpful for keeping track of all the little bits of time I spend on all these various projects. Before Clockify, the only way I could report my time (so it could be charged to the correct projects) was to look back through the email I had sent all week and guess how much time each effort took. Now I can just look at the Clockify report and report the actual hours spent on each! The reporting is not the whole benefit, though. If the recording were a hassle, I wouldn't use the tool - no matter how good the reporting. Fortunately, reporting time in Clockify is quick and easy. I can just enter text for the project, hit a button, and I'm off. If the project already exists, it's even easier - just press the \"play\" button next to the project. Altering time is easy too. \u2014 Mark F.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 A really useful tool Easy to use. The dashboard is really useful.

Clockify was easy to implement and use, enabling our team to better manage our resources and provide our clients with the reports they needed. And all of this was done at no cost!

The timer actually keeps me focused on the task and I don't get sidetracked with other projects.

The interface is very simple and straightforward. Often simple and easy means a lack of features and flexibility, but not in this case. Time can be categorized by project and tag in addition to space to detail exactly what you're working on (if needed). The reports are easy to find, customize, and interpret too.

Funds are always tight for nonprofits, so I also needed an affordable solution. Clockify perfectly fits the bill! \u2014 Melissa A.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Simple and useful time tracker It's a good and simple tool to log your time.

Breaking out by client and projects makes invoicing a breeze. I appreciate how much they are constantly improving the app as well. Makes me look forward to each update! Previously I used a complicated spreadsheet to track client/project hours. It was complicated and timely. The app has made tracking a breeze and I'm much more confident I'm billing all my hours each month. \u2014 Shelley R.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Great features with reasonable pricing We just switched to Clockify, and LOVE it so far. Even the free version has more features than we were using before, and the pricing to upgrade is very reasonable (unlike what we were using before) so obviously we have been thrilled. The interface is very nicely designed, and feels extremely snappy, quick and intuitive to use. Features like billable hours, rounding up, and branded reports are wonderful. \u2014 David S.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Great solution for great value The intuitiveness of the software really shines, along with its well designed and minimum UI, making Clockify a pleasure to use. The fact that it is free for their basic tier is brilliant, and lets you get a great feel for the product before upgrading to the software completely.

I usually just respond, \" it doesn't matter,\". But I recently started a large project and wanted to keep track of my time. Clockify fits the bill perfectly. I have added tasks to separate parts of the sampler and can see how many hours I spend on each section. When I finish I will be able to print out a summary and keep it with the project info. I find it very easy to use and have recommended it on several needlework sites. I am not a business, but Clockify a wonderful way to keep track of my hobby time. \u2014 Margaret B.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Happy customer I liked the ease of use and the ability to access it via an app on my phone. i needed a simple time tracker to track a side job and Clockify worked great. I'm planning on keeping this in my back pocket for future side jobs. \u2014 Ian H.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Best $10 ever! The multiple applications (website, phone apps) help staff more easily stay up on time entries. Also having the ability to setup weekly reminders should someone not log hours that meets the threshold really helps timely data entry. Even having different ways to enter time (tracker versus timesheet) has really helped adoption of the application. Allowing staff to enter as much or as little detail on their time entries has again added on another layer of end user adoption. Being able to \"group\" time entries based on projects has been a LIFE SAVER when it comes to reporting for grants or payroll. Clockify was so simple to implement and overall received a fairly quick buy in from the whole team. We write a number of grants each year for financial support and Clockify reports has saved so much time for our grant writer (whether it be based on a person or a project). And when we need to update the Accountant with vacation hours used in the past month, we no longer have to pull together multiple spreadsheets (we currently have 18 staff using Clockify).

Thank you Clockify, I really needed this! \u2014 Daleth M.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Great app for tracking your time I LOVE the time tracker feature - I'm not super savvy with a lot of new softwares but I was able to immediately log in and start using the one feature I was in most need of. As someone who is self-employed and occasionally works for others, I was in desperate need of a simple way to track where my time was going every day and to help show a client what exactly I was doing for them and how long I was working. I'm not a huge fan of a lot of bells and whistles, so the simple time tracker is all I use and has been incredibly helpful in tracking my productivity and ending the day knowing what I did instead of wondering where the time has gone. \u2014 Stephanie M.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Painless billing and time tracking I like being able to click \"Start\". It's a small thing, but it helps me focus on the task at hand. With a hand-written time sheet, I have to put down all the information at the beginning, or else I forget or get distracted. I've worked at places where tracking hours accurately was a nightmare. Everything was on spreadsheets entered in and tallied manually at all places. So much wasted time. Clockify streamlines billing and makes time tracking painless. \u2014 Verified Reviewer\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Consultant's dream I love the ease of tracking my time amongst multiple projects. i can easily Toggle between tasks without having to worry about the accuracy of my minutes.

I have been using it for a few weeks now and have all the features I could possibly need. Kudos to the Clockify team for putting up this tool that is actually useful as a free software, and not an advertisement for its paid version. Now, listing its pros: 1. The UI is clean and nice. Its distraction free and I love the color combination. 2. The Dashboard contains a lot of relevant and useful information. 3. You can export your reports to various formats (pdf, csv) so that's a big plus. The business problem was that we did not know how much time our projects were taking up and who was doing what work in detail. Clockify has solved this! \u2014 Binigya D.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Clockify made tracking job times too easy After using it for about 6 months I can surely say that this app is so intuitive and easy that I can just jump to work without worry if I am tracking times accordingly.

Plenty of options to set up your team and manage your time tracking needs. It can feel a bit overwhelming sometimes. An interesting pricing structure that gives you a lot for free. I've recommended it to a few agency friends over the years. \u2014 Hristian K.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Great for Freelancers Easy to track different projects for multiple clients and differentiate between billable and non-billable work; app is streamlined and easy to use throughout my day while the website makes it easy for me to dig into the data in detail.

There are many things I love about clockify! But, being a project manager in a small business the best thing was unlimited users for free! We have a lot of contractors and to have them be able to track time under our business anywhere for free is pretty awesome! Some projects we will have 3-7 people or more so it's fantastic that we don't need to pay for extra users every time we have a big project. I also enjoy the fact that you can assign a task to each user as a free option as well. There isn't a lot of limitations with Clockify's free option which was something that I kept running into with other time tracking software. My overall experience with Clockify has been great! I'm with a start-up small business and this was a perfect system to get our whole team time tracking! We have been using clockify since April and already start seeing results of estimates going over and catching when we've been going over hours in different departments.

Our business went from tracking hours on a notepad to this incredible program. What a tremendous difference it has made! It's free AND it allows us to clock in and clock out for specific hours/days instead of the traditional timer. Most of the other programs we considered are a pay-by-user. Also, the other programs we considered only had options to start a timer or fix time for that day. However, Clockify allows us to enter time manually for weeks previous, days in advance, etc. We have found that the reports are customizable on Clockify where other programs did not allow us to customize dates. \u2014 Gabrielle W.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Simple, that's what's great about it It doesn't try to do too much and end up cluttering the interface. It's easy to use and straightforward. It lets you categorize and tag your work, and track your work time. It has interfaces for web, native apps, and browser plugins. Truly cross-platform. Every other time tracker I've tried is ridiculously complex and/or more expensive than a simple time tracker should be. Clockify is filling a needed spot in the market.

Not only that, it is accurate and reliable. And as a time-keeping piece of software it is son non-demanding of the user's time - log in, choose a client, describe the activity and press start. Then press finish when you are finished. It really couldn't be easier.

Other apps have more modern designs, but at the expense of usability. The basics of any time tracking app is, of course, tracking time. Reports are also very helpful, along with tasks for a project. Clockify is the one app I've found that is free for all those features. It's well designed and thought out. Every feature you need is within quick access and simple to find. Clockify has a great free level, and upgrade price for more advanced features is very reasonable. It also is easy to use. Since I don't have a lot of time as a small business owner, I need to be able to jump in and use the program right away without downtime. No other app I've found has as easy an onramp as Clockify. \u2014 Jesse K.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Awesome application The UI/UX is so simple that anyone can use this application with zero setup and no prior knowledge. \u2014 Anuraj S.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Simple and Clean I like the simplicity, using clockify is simple. I'm a contractor and needed a simple app to track time, clockify has more than exceeded my expectations. The interface is smooth and intuitive and the reports it generates make me look more professional to my clients. I use this to track every hour of work I do and only spend about 30 seconds on the site - just set it and forget it; exactly what I wanted from a time tracker app. \u2014 Aaron G.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Clokify review after 3 months of use Simple Interface, all operating systems and major browsers for extensions are supported.

It's easy to use. Oh yeah, did i mention that it's free? \u2014 Troy J.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Nice way to keep track on your time Clockify has a really neat interface, and once completely configured it allows quick and easy operation. On the main screen, you can simply hit the start button on the project you're working on and hit again whenever you stop and it will add directly a new entry on the log of that project. That's pretty quick when you need just to focus on the work. Besides this, on this screen you can also select each entry and decide if it will be billable to the customer or not by just hitting another button. A really useful feature on Clockify is that you can set by default a billing price for your time, but also you're able to set a specific price per project, so when you set billable time to any project, it will apply the specific price in case it is set or the default one in the other case. The dashboard section is also quite nice, but less useful, but anyway it shows some interesting info such as total time worked, or total earnings, most active projects and so on. Then maybe the most interesting feature are the reports since are the ones that allows you to collect all the generated data.

This has been a great way to track time and help run meetings more smoothly. \u2014 Madison C.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Simple way to track your time We use Clockify to track time for our entire development process. The developers track time for each of their tasks individually, which makes it easy to see which features cost the most. Clockify changed the way we work and has increased productivity mainly because we now know which tasks we spent too much time on so we can avoid such pitfalls in the future. It is the simplest way to track your time. It lets us track all of the time we spend on billable projects and it gives us the price we should bill the clients for our work.

And it's constantly being improved too. The grouping of activities that was introduced last month cleaned up our reports. Overall it has helped improve transparency across the team, resource allocation and importantly, using it doesn't impact on productivity either... it's fitted into our workflow pretty seamlessly. Clockify has really improved the performance of my team, and the way in which we can review and assess the tasks, projects and clients that are taking too much of our time has led to significant efficiency improvement. Like other well-regarded brands, the best statement I can make is \"it just works\"... and is now an essential part of our workflow. \u2014 Matt C.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Answers the question \"How long did you really take to do...?\" Clockify is so dead simple to use. You set up your account and start counting the seconds. After you're done, you can round up your report to 15 minute time blocks and call it a day. As an Asana user, Clockify provides an instant link between my task on the website and the Clockify interface. \u2014 Tony C.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Free product that is better than other paid softwares I love that it is free and has better functionality than other softwares that I've tried and I had to pay for. I do part-time contract-based consulting on the side (I am a stay at home mom otherwise), and so I can't afford to pay for a software since it would be cost prohibitive.

It does exactly what I need it to do. Track time and provide basic reporting. Moving from a manual Google sheet to a tried and true organized timer has the added benefits of allowing me to simply run a report for billing purposes rather than tallying up time entries manually. \u2014 Trout F.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Great tool I have used many different time tracking tools at various jobs. When I set out on my own as a freelancer, I researched what else was out there. I was happy to find Clockify! The interface is user-friendly and I like how reports, projects, and clients are organized. It's very easy to use and helps keep me on track! I've really enjoyed using Clockify and have recommended it to multiple people! \u2014 Allison A.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Great hour tracking platform Clockify is very easy to use and allows users to register hours spents in projects rapidly without needing to know about the platform that much. We have a centralized place in which we register work entries, we can do it for several projects and obtain neat reports about the time entered. \u2014 Arel S.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Great software The software does a great job at monitoring time. It is not bloated with a ton of extra useless features and ads. Clockify helps with time management, time tracking, productivity monitoring, and session planning to assist with proper therapy session lengths. \u2014 Kenneth T.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Getting you lost money back! Working as a web developer, you always get that call from the client to change something in his website several months after delivery thinking that he will always have support for it because he is asking for something that is a \"5 minute job\" Logging the time from every project we realised all the time we were losing doing so simple jobs. We were spending to much time for nothing. With clockify you know where you spent every second of you time!!! And sending a beautiful report to your client he knows he has to pay for your time!

The reports help me show my boss that I spend x amount of time helping coworkers and y amount of time working on actual billable work. It's also great to show the extra hours I've put in. It also keeps track of timer running even if I accidentally close the screen or login from a different location. Overall it's a great app to run in the background and help keep me aware of how I spend my time during the day. \u2014 Jon P.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Time tracking made simple The software is intuitive with a first time user being able to immediately begin using the tool. It provides options for categorizing the time in functional ways that projects may need to be organized in. The reporting functionality and the resume time entry are some of my favorite features! I recently switched to consultant work and am still working with my previous company. I wanted a tool that I owned rather than using their corporate account used through a PM software. Not only do I own my time entry functionality now, it offers so many more options than I previously had! \u2014 Haleigh H.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Easy to use The ease of use and how easy it was to set up with our clients and project, etc. Clockify helps us track where we are spending most of our resources and where we need to allocate resources in areas we're not spending enough time.

It's nice to have a free software that integrates with my task manager too. It's been great. I have used other softwares that I paid a significant amount of money for.

My team likes it because of it's ease of use. \u2014 Kristy H.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Easy to use and affordable time tracking software This software is easy to use and that is what I thought was the best thing. I also like the fact that it allows you to effortlessly organize work by projects and clients. \u2014 Rahel W.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Nice UI, best way I've found to track time Works. Simple, easy to use, and does what it needs to do. A lot of trackers have too many features and it's not easy to use the basics. This gets it right by staying out of your way. The key point for a time tracker is to stay out of your way, and be reliable. This does both of those things. \u2014 Jason H.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Simple, Easy I like Clockify a lot. It allows for easy categorization of jobs, with easy descriptors to define what I'm doing with that particular block. Things can get picked up again-you can use the same category/description/entry twice or more, which makes things simple if you just needed to take a break. \u2014 Christopher T.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Clean and high functionality Clockify is awesome and really surpassed my expectations. It is free, easy to use and incredibly useful. The reports, while not incredibly extensive, are incredibly useful for us as an organization. Highly recommended. \u2014 Marco P.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Good Time tracking tool A good time tracker software for time tracking and all.

Moreover its totally free. \u2014 Nitesh D.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 The Most Functional Time Tracker As a graphic designer, it is important for me to provide my clients with the accurate amount of work that I did, broken down into tasks and projects so that they are able to see what they are paying for.

Simplicity vs functionality is a dilemma in modern softwares, one that Clockify excel in solving. The simple to use time tracker with the functionality of high end time trackers and a very reasonable price tag is what sold it for me. The ability to generate a full report, especially in format that is interactive in terms of date ranges, is a God sent feature that saved me the time from creating multiple reports. The organizational elements such as projects, clients, and workspaces allowed for a clean user experience where nothing is cluttered. \u2014 Elijah D.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Clockify has been a revelation to running my start-up I run a small start-up and freelance, which means a lot of juggling my own time and competing deadlines. When you're faced with endless to-do lists and different clients it's difficult to know what to do first, or if you're really spending the right amount of time on things. Using Clockify has allowed me to make sure I'm actually spending the time I say I will on a project, and let's me highlight what I've been working on, so I can adjust my priorities if I need too. It's also better shown me how much time I've spent on paid projects, so I can better price my services and increase my profits. The ease of use of Clockify is possibly the best bit about it - the Chrome extension is a godsend. It's simple to use and has good integrations with other software like the Google Suite and email. Unlike other paid versions of this kind of stuff, it also has a really decent free version so you really get time to work out if this is the right software for you, rather than just jumping in at the deep in. \u2014 Jem C.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Tried this for my team I loved that it was easy to use and that there are reports to print. It has so many features that i am looking for with a great price tag. i was using a different time tracking software and found it overly expensive for what i was using it for. This one is amazing! \u2014 Lindy R.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Clockify your time!

There are many features that are really useful, but frankly, all I needed was as simple as possible time-tracking tool. It is super easy for use.

Much better option than excel. We're a small startup with only 3 employees. I'm salary, and i currently make up the entire engineering team. i use Clockify to quantify how much time i spend on various tasks/projects to get an idea of the R&D cost to the company for any given product. It also doubles as a good way to gauge how long you have been doing a specific task. i find it helps keep me on task, and helps me to recognize when I'm multitasking when I'd rather be focusing on one task. Though tracking your time is difficult at first, sort've like a new excersize regimen, eventually the brain becomes accustomed and it is super easy to do. I'd recommend this service to anyone. \u2014 Richard M.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Affordable time tracking Starting off the price. I cannot find anything close to it in value. We also liked the integration that it offered with multiple platforms. Overall it has helped with marking time as billable and being able to accurately track our times. \u2014 Derek L.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Clockify is like my time-clock app, but without extra hastle I'm a student, and I've been keeping track of hours spent towards various classes and assignments. This app has been very useful and flexible, meeting my needs as a student. i think it will be very useful if i ever have billable hours i need to log later and the visualizations/summaries are pretty nice to have. As a student, I've been able to easily track hours spent towards various classes, assignments, etc. The ability to edit times has been really nice too. \u2014 Sterling B.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Fantastic time tracking app It's really easy to use, just click and get on with it. Business efficiencies have doubled in one week. i hadn't realised how much more is possible when you know you are against the clock.

Right on the initial screen you can create a Project, mark as billable or not, add tags, select a specific client and start your tracking on that task.

Clockify wins in many aspects here, I will list them out below. 1) Easy to use - it is easily accessible using a web browser and mobile, 2) Flexible - one can track time using the timer or chose to update it at the end of the day, also allows editing. 3) Fantastic individual & Admin dashboards. 4) Project-specific filtering. 5) Fantastic reporting capabilities.

Exporting my tracked time is a great advantage too because I don't want to be stocked at one platform. \u2014 Eric R.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Awesome work Easy to use.

I am happy with the product. Easy to use. \u2014 Susan H.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Great fully featured time-tracking software Even the free version includes enough features to be a professional time-tracking solution.

This software resolves the time tracking issues that I've had in the past when it was just me. i would find myself putting way more time on one project than the client paid for, which put other projects on the backburner. i needed a way to monitor and control this so i can spend the right amount of time on each client project. \u2014 Ashley S.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Great time saving tool I am using Clockify as a way of recording time spent on projects to be able to report timings to the PM. One of Clockify's best tools is the play button - which yes is featured in some competitor products - but Clockify allow you to override the time easily if you need to. The other fantastic thing about Clockify is the user experience. Everything is logical to figure out without watching a lengthy tutorial first - although there are great videos available if you get stuck. \u2014 Erika S.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 The perfect time tracker This is a very easy piece of software to get straight into and use - it's immediately useful.

It have a functions that is really needed free of charge (They have a very competitive paid plan as well). For solo users it allows to add clients, projects, tags and workspaces. In addition, For teams they provide a very storng permissions on workspace level. all these are in a cheapest price between all alternative services. \u2014 Mueen M.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 A Timer You'll Run Everyday For the last few years of using Clockify, I realized one thing... there's no other time tracker on the web that I'd use. It's really simple to use, responsive, a surprising uptime, and a nice minimalist interface that looks clean and informative at the same time. I use it for several clients especially because you can easily send them a report when needed, sort time clocked for EACH of the clients in your database PLUS, you can even change the rate for each client. Overall, a really impressive web time tracker that any business or freelancer should use. \u2014 Ellen Marie D.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Multiple clients and projects This tool is great for managing multiple clients and projects.

So i went out and looked to find a piece of software that could log and keep track on our projects. Clockify fills that gap and i am very happy and excited about this program. \u2014 Moises C.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Nice product providing detailed activities updates with timing Its showing Timing of Projects with Detailed Person to Person Reporting. \u2014 Dharmesh P.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Good free product, haven't used the paid version (yet) The user interface is really easy to interact with. \u2014 Ben D.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Easiest time tracker I've found Clockify allows me to create workspaces, clients, projects, and more. It allows me to break down my time tracking in the ways that are most useful to me, including creating projects and assigning tasks. i can then just click a project, click a task, and click to start tracking. It's simple, easy, and intuitive. I've never had a single problem with Clockify, compared to other software I've tried that made things way too complicated. i love Clockify. It's easy to use, keeps time tracking simple and sensible, and doesn't offer me a lot of extra stuff that i don't want. It doesn't pressure me to buy anything, and it doesn't have the most useful features locked behind the paywall. \u2014 Wendy M.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Very affordable and convenient to use Clockify has never disappointed us. Therefore, I have nothing against it. It is ridiculous. The support team is world-class and the experience with Clockify is fantastic.

Definitely beats shared Excel files!!! \u2014 Sonia Heimann I love Clockify! I have and will continue to recommend you to my friends and colleagues in lieu of Toggl. Your free vs paid features make much more sense than theirs! Please don't ever change that like Toggl did some time back, putting some of their core functionality behind a paywall. Keeping yours free is your edge in the market as well as your number-one lead capture! \u2014 Joe Ammel, Owner at YourContentEditor I just want to tell you that I'm so happy with what you guys have created.

I find it useful to know how long I'm spending on mixing and mastering projects so I can look at ways to improve my efficiency but also check that I'm charging the right price and not working for less than minimum wage by the time the project is complete. By keeping the tasks the same for every project, I can track and calculate my time spent versus project cost to see if I'm taking too long or possibly need to charge more or up my rates.

Just within the last couple of months it's already saved me hours of time, with the ability to track activity and run reports. Until this point, we had an internal, organized Google Spreadsheet system which was working but was lacking admin automation. (I was manually copying and pasting each team member's hours to calculate each project's bottom line, etc.) With Clockify I can see a day/week/month/manual view per team member or client.

When you break your day into segments and tune in to how you can save a minute or two, it all adds up. \u2014 Tony Sargeant Thanks for your great product! It provides all the basic functionalites over a simplistic interface. \u2014 Pouria Khakpour Congrats on the great platform that you have built. We have been looking at a replacement of our current time tracker - Office Time. i have stumbled on Clockify rather incidentally, after looking into Zoho Projects, Bitrix 24 and TSheets. I must say, the features and pricing of Clockify far exceed the other platforms. They are just too difficult to understand and start using. Clockify seems very convenient and very much like Office Time with the added benefits of cloud sync and much better filtering of jobs. \u2014 Nikolay Dimitrov, Chromeye I'd like to say i appreciate your service. Clockify is very beautiful and smooth to operate, I'm actually surprised such clean service is actually free. \u2014 Daniel Candelario, JPC IT Solutions By far the best priced and easy to use option available. As my business grows I have the option to upgrade with more features. \u2014 Diane Link, Owner at Link Healthcare Advantage, LLC Nice tool to keep track of my project hours.It's easy to switch between projects and start and stop the clock. It is easy to obtain a weekly sum of working time for each project, which is just what I need. \u2014 Hanne Heiberg, senior scientist at Norwegian Meteorological Institute Nice tool to keep track of my project hours. I have been working freelance marketing/design/web dev for a year now after being laid off from my full-time position last November. I was never a fan of logging my time. I usually could just guesstimate and put it into a janky google spreadsheet until I was ready to invoice. The last few months have picked up so much that my old method of time-tracking and sheet-making was getting cumbersome and hard to keep track. In September, I found Clockify and it has been such a helpful tool for my freelancing. It is so easy to use, clean interface, well organized, and free. I just love it! Anyways, just wanted to pass along my thanks for creating this great tool. \u2014 Sadie Lesko, freelancer Excellent time tracking software for any complexity of project.

You created a great piece of software. i really like it. Keep it up! \u2014 Dominik Kuss, Head of Technology at Standpunkt I love that you developed this app. You see, i was looking for alternatives because yes, i have been working with Toggl for 2 years now, and have a lot of time tracking reports there. Everything was fine, because i had a team of 5. But now, the moment we are about to go to 6 employees, i need more. And your app looks and feels the same as Toggl, but a little bit more elegant. i like that. i love that i can just log in, search for a date, and figure out how much time it took us to finish a project, so we can project realistic deadlines for future projects. \u2014 Mark Diaz, C.E.O. at 2D Animation 101 Fantastic system, everything we actually needed from Toggl, but free! \u2014 Hayden Ferriby, Quarterbridge The absolute best.

It is easily the best time tracking tool I've found in the last several weeks that I've been looking. The way the browser extensions seamlessly integrate tools like Trello is fantastic. I'm looking forward to integrating this into the workflow at our company - i think it's going to be quite revolutionary. i also appreciate the number of features that you have made available at the free and low-cost tier.

It is so nice that I have started using the free version at my office to track my work time. Again, I am very pleased with your product. Thank you for the fine product. I use Clockify for two purposes: one to track personal time I spend on hobby and other non-work tasks and the other for logging time at my office. I was previously using a simple spreadsheet to keep track of my time at work which I would transfer to our offices \"official\" timesheet. I still have to create the official timesheet, but now I use an export of the weekly Detail report. \u2014 William Frame, Community Action Partnership of Madera County Clockify exemplifies a quote written on an Apple marketing brochure in 1977. \"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.\" The Clockify UI is clean, uncluttered, simple, intuitive and functionally complete. It did everything I expected and more. Kudos to your team and company. \u2014 Frank Zwolinski Just started using Clockify - very useful app, i really appreciate it. \u2014 Norbert Szabo I have a 55 person staff team. Each person on the team can work on one of six different projects over the course of a 2-week pay period. We used to have a paper timesheet with six different columns, one for each project, where the staff would fill in their hours for the correct project and day. When the time came to process those timesheets and send the information to our payroll department, I had to collect 55 timesheets and calculate totals for each project and day. Needless to say, it took a substantial amount of time to complete. Then we found Clockify. It is very simple and allows our staff to enter start and end time for activities in an app. I can then see in the Dashboard who has worked where and when, and complete my payroll. I can also generate a spreadsheet and store it for archive and auditing purposes. Because I work at a charity organization, and we have little to no budget, the fact that Clockify is free for unlimited number is users is a major plus.

Big names have been there too, so they\u2019ve fine-tuned their routines to perfection. Clearly, habits and routines matter in your pursuit of success \u2014 but they\u2019re innately different. So, let\u2019s compare these 2 concepts and explore the daily routines of successful people to see how you can maximize productivity. What is the difference between routines and habits? Although habits and routines are both regular and repeated activities, there\u2019s a difference between them. According to a study on habitual behavior, we engage in habits subconsciously. Still, we rely on cues to remind us to start our habitual actions. For example, you may have a habit of brushing your teeth right after eating. So, finishing a meal and leaving your dining table would be your cue to head for the bathroom. But, can routines also become second nature? Unlike habits, routine behavior doesn\u2019t depend on a trigger but requires conscious and deliberate effort. For instance, a part of your daily routine may be going for a run. But, even if you enjoy physical activity, you\u2019re not likely to walk outside and start running on autopilot. In short, habits are automatic behaviors triggered by a cue while routines require intentional practice. Why are routines and habits important? The road to success is paved with consistent action. So, forming established routines and healthy habits is the best way to remain steadfast in chasing your goals. Developing productive habits has many merits \u2014 whether you're focused on a particular goal or not. According to a paper on lifestyle behaviors, habitual actions can improve your quality of life by promoting creativity and better mental health. When we form a habit out of a daily, time-consuming task, it becomes automatic and no longer demands our full attention. While that task is at the back of our minds, we can shift our focus to creative thinking. Daily routines and habits of successful people There\u2019s no ultimate recipe for success. Still, routines and habits are a vital addition to the daily lives of many productive individuals. So, there must be a connection. Let's connect the dots by looking at the daily routines of successful people and their list of habits. #1: Barack Obama\u2019s daily routine The 44th president of the United States contributed to multiple changes in his country.

According to research on sleep health, Beethoven maintained healthy sleep habits \u2014 keeping a regular sleep schedule and getting enough hours of sleep. A good night\u2019s rest improves attention and memory, which allowed him to spend 8 hours composing and lead an active social life. #17: Maya Angelou\u2019s daily routine Apart from being the first female inaugural poet in US history, Maya Angelou is famous for her unusual writing routine. Maya Angelou\u2019s schedule - The poet would wake up at 5:30 a.m. - From 7 a.m. to 2 p.m., she sat down for her writing sessions. Maya\u2019s creativity was fueled by the habit of renting out hotel rooms to avoid distractions. - Upon coming home, Angelou would revise her writing, shower, and have dinner. - Between 7:30 p.m. and 8 p.m., she would go over her work with her husband - Her bedtime was at 10 p.m. Maya Angelou ensured uninterrupted focus by writing in hotel rooms to avoid disturbances. #18: Coco Chanel\u2019s daily routine The iconic fashion designer and businesswoman achieved greatness through hard work. Her timeless elegance is reflected in her simple everyday routine.

Although Coco Chanel prioritized work and didn\u2019t take breaks, she managed to adjust her schedule to her biological rhythm. #19: Sigmund Freud\u2019s daily routine Sigmund Freud\u2019s dedication to developing revolutionary theories cemented him as the founder of psychoanalysis. However, he also spent long hours treating patients in his private practice. To maintain a healthy work-life balance, Freud carefully structured his day. Sigmund Freud\u2019s schedule - Freud would get up at 7 a.m. - He would take a cold shower and have a barber trim his beard and hair. - From 8 a.m. until noon, Freud would hold consultations \u2014 devoting 55 minutes to each patient and taking 5-minute breaks between sessions. - At 1 p.m., he had lunch with his family. - Until 3 p.m.,", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

What do successful people have in common? Based on the daily habits of successful people, here are the main commonalities that form a productive routine. Strict schedule The daily routines of famous personalities rarely change, which helps them maintain a healthy work-life balance. According to the daily rituals of successful leaders, following a consistent routine keeps distractions at bay and raises your productivity levels. Getting up early Many entrepreneurs are early birds. After all, morning people tend to have healthy sleep patterns, leading to more energy, better organization, and higher efficiency. As mentioned in our schedule examples, the best morning routine includes self-care activities, like: - Showering, - Eating breakfast, - Meditation, - Working out, etc. Exercising Most successful people engage in some form of daily exercise \u2014 from walking to working out. Overall, regular physical activity is tied to better focus and lower stress levels. Interestingly, a survey on morning vs. night workouts shows that people who exercise in the morning are 129% more likely to believe it improves productivity at", "tokens": 1000, "node_type": "child"}

Interestingly, a survey on morning vs. night workouts shows that people who exercise in the morning are 129% more likely to believe it improves productivity at work. However, if you're most productive in the morning, we suggest you prioritize work and exercise later. Eating breakfast Most successful people don\u2019t skip the first meal of the day. Likewise, you should start your day with breakfast to get the initial energy boost you need for the day\u2019s activities. In fact, nutritionists advise against skipping breakfast since it negatively affects your mental performance \u2014 especially your memory and concentration. Time blocking Crafting a schedule means you've allocated a specific time to each activity. But some entrepreneurs take this to the next level. For example, Musk assigns different days to different companies while Dorsey dedicates each day to a certain work area. Others complete their work in multiple sessions, taking productive breaks in between, like Sigmund Freud. With time blocking, you can achieve daily goals and prevent burnout by scheduling leisure activities. A day in the life of an American The American Time Use Survey (ATUS) revealed the average amount of time Americans spent on regular activities in 2023: - Sleep \u2014 People slept for 9.1 hours every day. - Work \u2014 People spent 8.1 hours on work and work-related activities. On workdays, home-based employees worked for 5.1 hours, and in-office employees did so for 7.9 hours. - Leisure \u2014 People invested 5.5 hours in leisure and sports activities \u2014 like socializing, watching television, or exercising. On average, men spent 5.6 hours on these activities, while women spent 4.8 hours. - Household chores \u2014 People did household activities for 2.4 hours every day. Specifically, women spent 2.7 hours on chores while men spent 2.1 hours. - Childcare \u2014 Adults with children under age 6 spent circa 2.3 hours providing primary childcare \u2014 activities including physical care, playing, and sharing hobbies with children. However, parents with children between 6 and 17 spent only 52 minutes on their care. For the average Joe, sleep and work take up most of the day, followed by leisure activities, housework, and childcare. How can you become a highly productive person? The daily routines of successful people prove that consistency is key to increasing your productivity levels. Still, that doesn\u2019t explain how you can adjust your list of habits for that purpose. So, here are our top 4 tips for creating a successful routine that you\u2019ll stick to. 1) Prioritize your night routine The best morning routine starts with a good night\u2019s rest. However, that will depend on how you spend your evenings. That\u2019s why you should put your nights first when planning a schedule. A study", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

However, that will depend on how you spend your evenings. That\u2019s why you should put your nights first when planning a schedule. A study on the effects of sleep quality confirms that sleep deprivation causes job stress, and, by default, productivity loss. Based on over 3,000 responses, the survey shows that: - 41.1% of participants have sleep problems, and - 55.3% of participants have occupational stress. But, how can you tell if your sleep schedule is off? First, ask yourself the following questions: - How would you describe your sleep quality? - How many hours of shuteye do you get per night? If the answers suggest something wrong about your sleep pattern, make changes to increase productivity. To fix your sleep schedule and get 7-9 hours of shuteye, research on sleep health advises you to: - Set up your sleep and wake-up time, - Exercise for at least 30 minutes during the day, - Avoid smoking and drinking coffee and alcohol before bed, - Avoid watching TV or using your smartphone before sleep, and - Do a relaxing activity before bedtime \u2014 like a warm shower or reading. Improving your sleep habits is a necessary step toward boosting your work performance and overall health. 2) Leverage your peak productivity time To form a winning daily routine, you need to identify your peak productivity hours or your biological prime time \u2014 the time of day when you experience optimal energy and focus. Taking advantage of your most productive hours will help you avoid overwork. To illustrate, imagine you're a UX designer whose main focus is research analysis. If you start your day by checking emails and delay important tasks, you may end up working overtime. So, what\u2019s the best strategy to use your peak productive hours? You can try time tracking to ensure you finish the toughest tasks during your focus time. By tracking time spent per task, you can easily figure out how long it takes you to complete it. As a result, you'll be able to pinpoint the exact parts of the day when certain tasks come easier to you. And here\u2019s how you get there. On Monday, upon logging into the time tracking app, do one of your most important tasks first. Simply start the timer and stop once you finish each task. On Tuesday, start your task later in the day and let the timer tell you how long you've worked on it. After a while, you'll have enough data to recognize a pattern in your workflow. With this information, you can organize your work schedule to fit the biggest tasks into your most productive hours. 3) Don\u2019t ignore your to-do list Many people create", "tokens": 1000, "node_type": "child"}

With this information, you can organize your work schedule to fit the biggest tasks into your most productive hours. 3) Don\u2019t ignore your to-do list Many people create to-do lists only to push them aside during work. Others fail to check off all of the list items for various reasons \u2014 whether it's additional work or a poorly planned day. Regardless, following to-do lists should be part of your daily routine \u2014 with undeniable pros like: - Better task prioritization, - Sense of accomplishment, - Reduced stress, - Improved focus, and - Increased productivity. But, how can you use your to-do lists effectively? According to research on to-do lists, only around 40% of tasks get checked off. So, make sure that your priorities are included in that percentage. The study provides other useful tips, such as: - Set realistic time estimates, - Include no more than 7 activities, - Write down tasks in specific terms, - Move unfinished tasks onto tomorrow\u2019s checklist, and - Create your list at the end of the previous day to avoid procrastination. Generally, creating checklists gives you a sense of order and sets a clear intention \u2014 improving your chances of following through. 4) Make time for self-care Finding enough time for self-care activities before jumping into work can decrease your chances of burnout and ensure optimal productivity. The facts speak for themselves: Health experts on burnout prevention say that people who spend 20% of their time on personal interests are less likely to experience burnout. Based on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the most popular leisure activities are: - Watching TV, - Socializing, - Relaxing and thinking, - Playing games, - Reading, and - Doing sports and recreational activities. Despite your often chaotic schedule, try to set aside at least 15-20 minutes of self-care time. Drinking a glass of water only takes a moment! This practice will help you perk up, recharge, and handle the rest of the day without feeling overwhelmed.

What is DCAA compliance? When you obtain a government contract, DCAA (Defense Contract Audit Agency) is obliged to ensure your company follows the necessary timekeeping and accounting rules. On your part, this means your company should comply with the DCAA requirements to make it easier for the agency to assess you. Observing these rules is known as DCAA compliance. The DCAA timekeeping requirements regulate the documentation of employee working hours. In the government's eyes, time tracking documents provide proof that no time was wasted and no fraud committed regarding work time. That's why, to achieve DCAA compliance, it's vital to keep clear timesheets that document each employee's work hours. DCAA performs unannounced audits to find out whether contractors abide by their regulations regarding timekeeping. Their representatives may visit your company and talk to employees to check whether everything is in order. This practice is known as a floor check. A DCAA audit examines if businesses on government contracts do the following: - Practice daily time tracking - Keep precise records with audit trails for all changes - Practice extensive reporting - Obtain specific supervisor approvals, and more Benefits of DCAA compliant timekeeping Following all the DCAA timekeeping requirements has many advantages apart from securing you a government contract. They include the following: - Streamlined processes and workflows \u2014 Having a strict timekeeping policy helps everyone stay organized, prioritize, and divide their work into more manageable tasks. - Improved efficiency \u2014 Daily time tracking allows you to see how employees spend their work hours and if there's room for more efficiency. - No delayed payments to your company \u2014 Your time tracking procedures help you stay on top of all the necessary documentation, such as reports and invoices, which you can promptly send to your clients. - You're more likely to get a pass for future contracts \u2014 Passing your DCAA audits with flying colors makes you more likely to land another government contract in the future. - More transparent operations \u2014 Employees are in charge of their timesheets and can refer to them at any time. - Data-driven decisions \u2014 Having detailed insight into how employees spend their time can help you better prioritize tasks and make informed decisions about future projects. DCAA compliant timekeeping checklist Navigating DCAA timekeeping requirements can get tiresome and complicated, and we'll get to explaining them in detail in a second. But first, here's a simplified list of the DCAA time tracking conditions to help you get the gist of it: - Everyone in your company needs to track time. - Employees must record all hours they work (even overtime, vacation, unpaid, etc.). - Employees must log time themselves (managers and supervisors shouldn't log time for others). - Employees need to log time daily (all timesheets need to be completed at the end of each day). - Employees need to specify what", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

DCAA can visit and interview your employees to see if they are at work and check how well they understand the procedures, whether they are working on the right projects, and if their time records back this up. DCAA timekeeping requirements For a more in-depth understanding of DCAA compliant timekeeping, we take a closer look at the agency's time tracking requirements. DISCLAIMER: The timekeeping requirements listed here are taken from the Information for Contractors Pamphlet found on the DCAA website. However, it's worth noting that the official DCAA Contract Audit Manual (CAM) no longer matches the information found in the pamphlet, and some sections about timekeeping referenced in the CAM's Keyword Index don't exist in the relevant chapter of the manual (i.e. 5-909). We advise you to contact your local DCAA field audit office (FAO) for more information. Creating a company-wide timekeeping policy The first step in ensuring compliance is to write up a formal timekeeping policy that reflects the DCAA requirements. This policy will serve as a guide for your employees and provide the DCAA auditors with information on what to expect from your time tracking system. Ensuring familiarity with timekeeping procedures Everyone must be familiar with timekeeping procedures to ensure employees track their hours properly. These procedures should be clearly laid out and easy to understand, for both employees and the supervisor. During a floor check, DCAA representatives may question any employee, so it's important that everyone is prepared.

During a floor check, DCAA representatives may question any employee, so it's important that everyone is prepared. Practicing daily time tracking All employees should track time every day individually in real-time. This also includes unpaid hours, overtime, and paid time off. Employees should log their time only for the current day, and refrain from adding backdated entries or entries for the future. Since all activities should be recorded daily as they happen, it's best to turn to a digital solution for this purpose, i.e. time tracking software, such as Clockify. It's easier to use, faster, and more precise than keeping time manually. Also, with DCAA compliant timekeeping software, you and your employees will be able to add time anywhere, across multiple devices, and have all data synced. With Clockify, employees can log their activities as time entries by using the work hours tracker. Alternatively, they can manually enter time in the timesheet. To prevent people from adding backdated entries, Clockify allows you to lock timesheets and implement timesheet approval. Enabling these features safeguards the time records against data tampering. Keep in mind that supervisors aren't allowed to log time for their employees, unless there is a valid reason for it, such as timekeeping for employees on sick leave or a business trip. Labor cost calculations DCAA calculates your project costs based on the number of hours your team worked, regardless of whether they're paid by the hour or not. Clockify automatically calculates labor costs based on hours worked. You simply define the hourly rate for each employee, and whenever you run a time report you'll also get labor costs, in addition to seeing hours worked. Obligatory overtime recording Regardless of whether employees are paid by the hour or have fixed salaries, all overtime must be recorded. This is because employees' average hourly rate varies depending on the number of hours they've worked, i.e. it changes if they've worked overtime. As mentioned in the previous point, without overtime recorded, it's impossible to calculate correct labor costs. In Clockify, you can estimate the number of hours it'll take to finish each task assigned to a team member, which translates to how many regular working hours they are expected to spend on those tasks. You'll be able to track the progress of each project on the projects page (tracked vs estimated time) and the progress of each task once you click the chart icon of the individual project. You'll be able to see the estimated vs tracked time for each task and check whether anyone worked overtime on their task or is close to the limits.

Alternatively, you can check your employees' work hours in the weekly report and see whether anyone has clocked in over 8 hours a day or 40 hours per week. There are two types of overtime: - Uncompensated overtime \u2014 For exempt employees (salaried employees earning a minimum of $684 per week) under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Overtime that isn't paid as the contract provides the employee with a fixed salary, which stays the same, no matter the number of hours worked. - Paid overtime \u2014 For nonexempt employees (other salaried and hourly employees) under FLSA. This type of overtime has to be paid. Both types of overtime should be included in your employees' timesheets. Not recording overtime can be interpreted as fraud. That's because the company's profits increase as every hour of overtime lowers the effective hourly rate it pays its exempt employees. Need help calculating overtime pay? Try our Overtime Pay Calculators.Recording paid time off Paid time off includes: - National holidays, - Sick leave, vacation, - Personal time, - Family and parental leave, and - Pay during bereavement. By providing timekeeping data on paid time off, you ensure you avoid labor accounting fraud in the eyes of the government. In general, all work-related time must be reported. Categorizing all logged time by project/task DCAA requires the company to specify on what task and project the employees spent their work time. Each time an employee starts working on a task, they should create a time entry under the project the task belongs to. To make sure all entries fall under a specific project in Clockify, you can go to your workspace settings and select \"Project\" as a required field. This way, employees won't be able to track time on an activity unless they select a project. You can make tasks linked to specific projects by default, so when employees select a task, they will automatically select the project the task falls under as well. To make sure all entries have a specified task, just select \"Task\" as a required field in your workspace settings. Employees won't be able to track time on an entry without selecting a task. Recording all changes All changes in time tracking data need to be recorded so that the government has an insight into why the changes were made. To make sure all the data is correct and in sync, you can again turn to Clockify's locked timesheets feature. This way, no one will be able to make changes to entries after a date and time you select. Clockify also allows you to keep track of all the changes via an audit log.

Employees and supervisors co-approving time records Users can submit their weekly timesheets for official approval. Then, supervisors can see their timesheets in a detailed report and make sure everything is categorized properly. When employees and supervisors make sure everything is in order, admins can officially approve timesheets. Once a timesheet is approved, it can no longer be edited by anyone. If there is a mistake and employees need to make changes to approved timesheets, they can log additional time and submit the new entry for approval. Alternatively, admins can withdraw approval and edit the timesheet. When an admin withdraws approval, an audit log of the changes will remain so that you (and DCAA) can easily trace them. Separation of timekeeping from labor-related responsibilities You should separate responsibility for timekeeping from that for payroll and other labor-related activities. The payroll staff should not have any control over employees' time tracking data. When the monthly time tracking is done, the manager can request that all employees generate summary reports on their tracked time and then export them as a PDF. Once the manager receives the reports, they can forward them to payroll. Clockify summary report example Allocating charges to appropriate cost objectives Make sure to include the hourly rates for all team members in the workspace, to properly calculate billable hours. If you have a default hourly rate for the entire Clockify workspace, simply indicate the price in the workspace settings, and all projects and team members' rates will be calculated according to this rate. You can also set specific hourly rates for each project on the project's page. Alternatively, you can set hourly rates for individual team members working on each project, and the rates will be calculated based on that data. Once you have the hourly rates sorted out, it'll be easy to calculate the price for each project, in compliance with the DCAA requirements. To calculate the price for a project, go to the summary report, select the period when your team worked on that project, and filter results by the said project. You can then generate results as a PDF report and send it out. Properly assigning tasks to employees The project's manager should clearly indicate who's", "tokens": 1002, "node_type": "child"}

Properly assigning tasks to employees The project's manager should clearly indicate who's in charge of what task \u2014 the manager assigns the job, the employee performs it. In Clockify, you can simply: - Define and add tasks in the project's Task tab, - Add team members in the Team tab, and - Assign team members with the tasks corresponding to their job descriptions. Securing time tracking software accounts Employees must properly secure their accounts within the company's time tracking software. Once users receive invites to join Clockify, they get a link to generate their own, secure passwords. DCAA encourages password changes at least once every 6 months to keep data completely secure. If you want to go the extra mile to secure user access, you can rely on Clockify's single sign-on system (SSO) feature that comes with the Enterprise plan. Signing timesheets All timesheets must be signed, preferably electronically. But, the supervisor can print out the timesheets and manually sign them if necessary. Issuing information on costs monthly Information on costs and billing has to be issued at least once a month. You can easily generate this data monthly in Clockify. Just go to the summary report, select \"last month\u201d in the date picker, and you'll get a chart showing how many hours you've tracked in the previous month. You'll get info on how much of it was billable vs non-billable each day of the month. You can also find information about your earnings in the header of the chart. Once you have the desired data, you can export the document as a PDF or Excel and prepare it for the DCAA representatives. Exporting a report in Clockify Obligatory participation in timekeeping Finally, all employees within the company must participate in timekeeping and cooperate to meet the necessary requirements. NOTE: Using time tracking software is not enough to be DCAA compliant Clockify does allow you to track time in a way that's compliant with the DCAA regulations, but using Clockify or any other time tracking software doesn't make you DCAA compliant by default. For example, in Clockify, admins can edit employees' timesheets (albeit, with a clear audit log). However, bear in mind that, according to DCAA, managers shouldn't edit employees' timesheets without their explicit knowledge and consent. So, you're responsible for using your timekeeping software in a DCAA compliant way. In this particular case, you should lock time so that no one can edit it, at least not without a written trace (for audit purposes).

All those decimals can look confusing. Our time-to-decimal calculator is here to help you. Use it to turn time into decimals in an instant. Keeping track of how much time your staff members spend on a project is essential for payroll management. To keep a record of the time your employees spend on such projects, you can use a time-tracking system that will help you get all the hours in a regular format \u2014 HH:MM:SS. However, proper payroll calculation sometimes requires converting working hours to decimals. In this blog post, we\u2019ll help you convert working hours to decimal time, and you\u2019ll also learn: - What the decimal time system is and when to use it, - How the decimal time system was invented, - Example chart of minutes converted to decimals, - What a time-to-decimal calculator is and how to use it, and - Fun facts about using the decimal time system. So, let\u2019s find out what the decimal time system is and why it is used. What is the decimal time format and when to use it? First of all, let\u2019s make a distinction between the decimal and conventional format for displaying time. The conventional time format is represented in the hours and minutes format. For example, 5:30 is pronounced as \u2018\u2019five hours and thirty minutes\u2019\u2019 which implies that there are: - Five periods of sixty minutes (an hour), and - One period of thirty minutes. On the other hand, the decimal hours format represents time as regular decimal numbers. Let\u2019s explain this further using the aforementioned example, by converting 5:30 to decimal time. In the decimal format, 30 minutes is represented as \u20180.5\u2019 since 30 minutes is actually half an hour. Here\u2019s the equation: 5 hours = 5.0 in decimal time 30 minutes = 0.5 in decimal time Therefore, 5:30 equals 5.5 in the decimal time format (5 + 0.5). Now, if you\u2019re wondering who uses the decimal hours format, this system is particularly beneficial for accountants. Accountants use decimal hours for calculating payroll and how much time employees have spent doing a particular project. Let\u2019s move on to a brief history class \u2014 we\u2019ll go back in time and learn how the decimal time format was invented. How the decimal time system was invented The decimal time system was first introduced by the French as the sign of breaking connections with tradition. Back then, it was known as the French Revolutionary Time and it started being used on November 24, 1793, during the French Revolution. Now, how did this time system look like? This is how the French decimal time was divided: - A day consisted of 10 hours, - An hour consisted of 100 minutes, and - A minute consisted of 100 seconds. Basically, one decimal hour was equivalent to 2 hours plus 24 minutes in conventional time. Therefore, counting time was", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

Basically, one decimal hour was equivalent to 2 hours plus 24 minutes in conventional time. Therefore, counting time was made straightforward, for example: - Noon was at 5 o\u2019clock \u2014 since the entire day included 10 hours and noon is in the middle, - The day was 40% over at the end of the fourth hour (or 9 hours and 36 minutes in conventional time), and - The day was 80% over at the end of the eight hour (or 19 hours and 12 minutes in conventional time). This method of calculating time proved very inconvenient and unpopular. That\u2019s why the French stopped using it after only 17 months \u2014 on April 7, 1795. And that\u2019s when you would think that the French would give up on this idea for good. However, you\u2019d be wrong. In 1897, the French tried to implement the decimal time system again. This is what the Commission de D\u00e9cimalisation du Temps proposed: - A day should consist of 24 hours, - An hour should consist of 100 minutes, and - A minute should have 100 seconds. Like the previous one, this proposal failed in 1900. Nowadays, accountants all over the world use decimal time system to calculate payroll for employees. And, for that reason, the decimal time system was brought back into use. Minutes to decimal hours conversion chart Now that you\u2019re familiar with the history of the decimal time system, let\u2019s see how exactly to convert minutes to decimal time. To convert time into decimal format, you need to divide minutes by 60. The decimals are rounded, since decimal hours show only two decimal places. For example, 26 minutes divided by 60 equals 0.433333. The repeating number 3 is rounded, so the result is 0.43. Let\u2019s look at an example chart for converting minutes to decimal hours. | Minutes | Decimal hours | |---|---| | 1 | 0.02 | | 4 | 0.07 | | 10 | 0.17 | | 17 | 0.28 | | 22 | 0.37 | | 26 | 0.43 | | 30 | 0.50 | | 34 | 0.57 | | 41 | 0.68 | | 49 | 0.82 | | 56 | 0.93 | | 60 | 1.0 | What is a time-to-decimal calculator and how to use it? A time-to-decimal calculator is a tool that will come in handy when you need to quickly convert your employee's hours and minutes into decimals. In turn, this will help you efficiently determine payroll hours.

We\u2019ll go through two examples: - Converting employee time to decimal time, and - Calculating employee pay. How to convert employee time to decimal time using the time-to-decimal calculator? You need to understand how employee hours are converted into decimal time if you're going to calculate employee pay. For payroll purposes, minutes are easily converted to decimals. As we already established, all you have to do is divide the number of minutes by 60. For example \u2014 your employee worked 25 hours and 35 minutes per week. Here's how to do the calculation: 35 / 60 = 0.58 Therefore, your employee worked 25.58 hours. Luckily, with a little help from our calculator, this will be calculated automatically. Converting employee time to decimal time helps you figure out the amount you need to pay your staff, which we\u2019ll cover in the following lines. How to calculate employee pay using the time-to-decimal calculator? To calculate how much you should pay your staff, add the employee's hourly rate to the time in decimal hours to determine their gross pay. For example, your employee worked 25.58 hours (as mentioned in the above example), and their hourly rate is $10.00. To get their total gross pay, multiply your employee's hourly rate by their total hours worked. Here's the formula: Hourly rate x total hours worked $10.00 X 25.58 hours = $255.80 Therefore, the employee\u2019s gross pay equals $255.80. If you don\u2019t want to deal with such calculations, you can use our time-to-decimal calculator. Just enter the time values in hours and minutes and hourly rate, and let the calculator do the work for you \u2014 you\u2019ll have your employees\u2019 working time expressed in decimals in an instant. Additional examples of decimal time system Beside using decimal time for payroll purposes, there are two more examples of the decimal-time implementation: - Stardates \u2014 introduced in the Star Trek franchise, and - Swatch Internet time \u2014 introduced by the Swatch watch company. Stardates in Star Trek A stardate is a fictional pseudo-decimal timekeeping system created for the Star Trek television and film franchises. The stardates in Star Trek were derived from the Julian system of the sixteenth century. The writers were told to choose four digits and a decimal for the original Star Trek series. For example, the stardate for the Year: 2023, Month: January, Date: 10, Hour: 10, Minute: 47, Second: 4", "tokens": 1000, "node_type": "child"}

The Stardate calculator will help you convert any conventional date into a stardate. Swatch Internet time The Swatch company first developed the notion of Internet Time (also known as .beat time or BMT \u2014 Biel Mean Time) in 1998 for their \"Beat\" watches marketing campaign. It was supposed to be a more straightforward form of global cooperation over the internet, since it lacked time zones. The official format involves inserting a @ sign before the current .beat and ranges from @000 to @1000 .beats daily. For example, 6 hours equals @250. beats in Internet Time.

You\u2019ve probably heard this saying before. There\u2019s nothing wrong with it \u2014 as long as the customer acts friendly when interacting with frontline workers. But, what happens when customers behave rudely toward such employees? In that case, workers still have to act nicely and smile \u2014 even though they don\u2019t feel like smiling at that moment. In other words, workers experience emotional labor. Now, this is just an example of what emotional labor means in the workplace. What is emotional labor? The person who originally coined the term emotional labor was Arlie R. Hochschild \u2014 an acclaimed sociologist and professor emerita at the University of California, Berkeley. However, nowadays, this term has a broader meaning because other experts have been expanding it. Let's have an overview of the definitions of emotional labor. The original definition of emotional labor by Arlie Hochschild In her book The Managed Heart, Hochschild defines emotional labor as \"regulating or managing emotional expressions with others as part of one's professional work role.\" In other words, as Hochschild explains in the interview for the Atlantic, emotional labor is \"the work, for which you're paid, which centrally involves trying to feel the right feeling for the job.\" She also adds that managing emotions at work usually means suppressing or stimulating feelings. Not all jobs require managing emotions. But, in some occupations, workers may need to adapt their emotions so they better fit the role. Suppressing and evoking feelings may go in two directions: - Acting extremely nicely and positively \u2014 for example, flight attendants have to be especially nice and pleasant to passengers. - Acting harshly \u2014 for example, bill collectors have to act tough to intimidate their clients. In the aforementioned book, Hochschild also talks about emotional dissonance \u2014 the discrepancy between how employees truly feel and the feelings they have to express when performing a job. The definitions of emotional labor today Apart from Arlie Hochschild, other authors, journalists, and experts have constructed other meanings of emotional labor. And, according to them, the term is not always tied to work. Here are the additional definitions of emotional labor: - By the New York Times (author Kristin Wong) \u2014 \"The duties that are expected of you, but go unnoticed.\" - By Mel Magazine (author Tracy Moore) \u2014 \"Free, invisible work women do to keep track of the little things in life that, taken together, amount to the big things in life: the glue that holds households, and by extension, proper society, together.\" - By Harper's Bazaar (author Gemma Hartley) \u2014 experiencing emotional labor means being \"the manager of the household, and that being manager was a lot of thankless work.\" For Hartley, emotional labor involves delegating household chores to partners. Women usually have to manage such duties. What is NOT emotional labor? Above, we've seen that some definitions of emotional labor are not tied to work. But, according to Arlie", "tokens": 1000, "node_type": "child"}

Women usually have to manage such duties. What is NOT emotional labor? Above, we've seen that some definitions of emotional labor are not tied to work. But, according to Arlie Hochschild, emotional labor only refers to workplace settings. That's why she believes that the following examples do not fall under the category of emotional labor. Doing household chores As Hochschild explained in the previously mentioned interview, taking care of household chores doesn't necessarily have to be emotional labor. However, when a person is feeling anxious about doing mandatory chores, such as those around the house \u2014 this becomes emotional labor. Planning social gatherings for friends and coworkers Now, what about a person who's always planning drinks after work or throwing parties for friends? Is that person experiencing emotional labor? Not exactly. Hochschild claims this is rather mental work. But, if people planning social events feel that this is disturbing them \u2014 this is emotion work, the term we'll discuss later. What are surface acting and deep acting? As per Hochschild, the most vital techniques employees use when performing emotional labor are: - Deep acting - Surface acting Deep acting In deep acting, employees modify their inner emotions so that these emotions are in line with the behavior they are expected to portray in the workplace. So, workers give their best efforts to actually experience the emotions they must show in the workplace. It takes time and a lot of effort to change your feelings (instead of faking them), so deep acting is not easy to learn. What are examples of deep acting? In The Managed Heart, Hochschild talks about the survey she did at Delta Airlines. Flight attendants working at this company go through a specific training program. The gist of this program is to help flight attendants learn how to deal with aggressive and rude passengers. During this program, cabin crew members learn deep acting methods such as: - When passengers behave impolitely or aggressively, flight attendants need to imagine that these travelers have been going through traumatic experiences, such as losing their loved ones. Doing so helps flight attendants stop thinking about themselves and their emotions regarding the situation at hand. Therefore, they find it easier to deal with aggressive passengers. - In addition, for flight attendants, rude passengers are not rude \u2014 they are simply scared people. - An airplane interior should not be considered a place inside a high-speed vehicle, but rather a living room. This way, flight attendants are just hosts in charge of making their guests (passengers) feel comfortable during their stay (flight). Being able to perform such examples of deep acting helps flight attendants show desired emotions with ease. So, even when flight attendants have their personal issues to figure", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

Being able to perform such examples of deep acting helps flight attendants show desired emotions with ease. So, even when flight attendants have their personal issues to figure out, they still need to put a smile on their faces while working. How to stay focused at work when having a personal crisisSurface acting As Hochschild points out in one study, surface acting happens when \"the body, not the soul, is the main tool of trade.\" In surface acting, employees hide their emotions and fake the desired ones \u2014 i.e. the emotions that are expected for a particular role. In addition, surface acting also includes faking a good mood when communicating with clients. What are examples of surface acting? An example of surface acting are waiters who always smile \u2014 even during busy hours at the restaurant, when they have a lot on their (serving) plates. Also, any workers who have face-to-face interaction with their clients. The reason is simple \u2014 these employees need to act extremely friendly when interacting with clients. The jobs that require emotional labor \"I have to have a smile on my face. Some mornings that's a little difficult...You're concentrating on what you're doing. It's a little difficult to have that smile all the time. I have one particular girl who says to me, 'What? No smile this morning?' So I smile. Clerks are really underpaid people.\" This is a quote from the book Working, by Studs Terkel. Since they are expected to smile all the time, receptionists are among those workers who deal with emotional labor. As the authors of Emotional Labor in the 21st Century claim, there are three common traits of jobs that require a high level of emotional labor: - Jobs that involve interaction with clients and customers, - Jobs in which employees have to evoke particular emotions from other parties, and - Jobs in which employers have control over the emotions of their employees. Now, what jobs, in particular, are linked with emotional labor? Here are some examples of such occupations: - Customer service jobs, - Hospitality industry employees, such as waiters, servers, receptionists, concierges, and similar job roles, - Flight attendants and other members of the cabin crew, - Taxi drivers, - Caregiving professions, such as nursing, therapy, and eldercare, - Teachers and professors (even those working with adults), - Employees working in human resources, and - Law enforcement personnel. In the HBR article on emotional labor in the on-demand industry, the author claims that workers employed in an app-based service (e.g. Uber, Airbnb, TaskRabbit) experience high levels of emotional labor. Namely, such firms have customer rating systems, which means that employees have to achieve almost perfect reviews \u2014 in order to not be deactivated. As", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

Namely, such firms have customer rating systems, which means that employees have to achieve almost perfect reviews \u2014 in order to not be deactivated. As a result, such workers need to provide customers with impeccable service. Moreover, they also need to adapt their emotional performance so that it suits certain expectations from customers and employers. Emotional labor vs emotion work Emotional labor should not be used interchangeably with the term emotion work, which is yet another concept Hochschild created. As we previously discussed, emotional labor involves managing emotions in a professional setting to fit the expected job roles. On the other hand, emotion work involves all those tasks that we do to make others happy and retain positive relationships with our friends, family, and partners. For example, performing emotion work means doing tasks such as: - Planning birthday parties and similar events, - Remembering important dates, - Writing thank-you notes, - Buying presents, and - Calling your family and acquaintances regularly. Another important difference between emotion work and emotional labor is that, for the latter, there are usually clear written instructions on how employees should behave at the workplace. For instance, workers know what emotions are desired for their job role. Also, sometimes employees undergo specific training programs, such as the one at Delta Airlines. However, in the case of emotion work, there aren't any emotional expectations or clear rules. In addition, people who perform emotion work do not expect any rewards for their activities. What are the consequences of emotional labor? The most common consequences of emotional labor are: - Burnout, - Fatigue, - Emotional exhaustion, and - Depression. How emotional labor leads to burnout The authors of the study Emotional Labor and Burnout: A Review of the Literature, refer to Morris' and Feldman's research on the consequences of emotional labor. According to Morris and Feldman, employees progressively start to experience burnout when their capacity for emotional dissonance is drained \u2014 which is a result of emotional labor. As we mentioned, emotional dissonance is a disagreement between felt and displayed emotions. So, when workers constantly need to manage their emotions, they become tired and de-energized. As a result, they start to experience burnout. When it comes to particular jobs that are linked with burnout, the study Emotional Labor and Burnout suggests that employees working in the caregiving service industry are likely to experience a higher risk of burnout. Another way to explain the link between emotional labor and burnout is to consider the role of surface acting. The same study mentions that surface acting can cause emotional exhaustion. That's because when surface acting, employees need to put effort into: - Suppressing negative emotions or - Evoking positive emotions. Thus, surface acting can also", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

Thus, surface acting can also drain energy, which can cause emotional dissonance. Further on, when constantly experiencing emotional dissonance, workers are at risk of exerting high levels of psychological effort \u2014 which can lead to burnout. Career burnout and its effect on healthHow emotional labor leads to fatigue Another study on the impact of emotional labor on health refers to a survey on emotional labor that employees working in the hotel industry experience. The survey included 1,320 hotel employees from 5 Seoul hotels. According to their results, there was a high link between emotional labor and fatigue. They also discovered that female hotel workers were more likely to experience emotional labor \u2014 which led to higher levels of fatigue compared to their male coworkers. Mental fatigue: what it is and how to overcome itHow emotional labor leads to emotional exhaustion Similar research on the health effects of emotional labor refers to a survey on teachers and how emotional labor impacts them. The survey included 703 Chinese teachers. According to their findings, when teachers performed surface acting \u2014 this type of emotional labor was linked with emotional exhaustion. As Mayo Clinic defines it, emotional exhaustion is \"a state of feeling emotionally worn out and drained.\" It is usually caused by stress. And, in most cases, emotional exhaustion intensifies over time. It's worth noting that the same study did not find any correlation between deep acting and emotional exhaustion. However, they also reported another interesting detail about performing deep acting: - It can lead to some levels of burnout, but - It can also lead to higher levels of well-being among teachers. How emotional labor leads to depression The previously mentioned study on the impact of emotional labor on health cites the survey on toll collectors and the emotional labor they engage in. In this survey, the participants were 264 female Korean toll collectors. According to their results, toll collectors were likely to experience depression \u2014 as a result of high levels of emotional labor.

In such cases, it's almost inevitable that they'll experience emotional labor. But, here's how employees can deal with emotional labor more effectively. Tip #1: Let your manager and coworkers know how you feel After an 8-hour shift during which you had to smile and be helpful to your customers \u2014 even the impolite ones \u2014 you feel mentally drained. Just think about it \u2014 your coworkers must be feeling the same. So, there's nothing wrong with letting them know how you feel. Your colleagues might have some practical tips to help you get through the day easily. Besides, sharing your emotional burden with someone else will help you feel slightly better. Apart from sharing your feelings with coworkers, you can also let your manager know how you feel. This is especially important if you frequently have to interact with abusive customers. Managers should be informed about such situations so they can take some measures if needed. How to show your boss how much you work (+ an email template)Tip #2: Think about the purpose of your work Be honest with yourself and consider whether you like your job. Does it fulfill you and are all those long work hours worth it? Or do you put up with your job only because you need to be financially stable? If you're happy with your job \u2014 good for you. If you're not \u2014 you need to think about the purpose of your job and whether you should keep it. So, try to see the bigger picture to be able to figure out the purpose of your job. Maybe you need this job because it helps you pay your bills. Or maybe you have kids and you want to provide them with everything they need. If you connect with your larger purpose, you'll know that your job is still important and meaningful. Thus, you'll need to accept that there will be negative sides to it, such as dealing with rude customers. In a way, experiencing emotional labor will be a price you pay to achieve your vital purpose. Tip #3: Take regular breaks This seems like a pretty obvious tip, but it's still quite an effective way to relieve stress. If your job allows you to take frequent breaks, be sure to use them to unwind, chat with your colleagues, or simply clear your mind. Surface acting can surely negatively affect your mental health.

Tips for managers on how to help employees deal with emotional labor Aside from employees, managers are in a position to help their workers manage emotional labor. Here are some ideas on how team leads can lend a helping hand. Tip #1: Show your employees you trust and support them When employees are struggling with suppressing or evoking their emotions, it's vital that their managers support them. This is particularly essential in situations when workers have to deal with rude customers. In such cases, team leads need to let employees know that they trust and support them. Once employees feel appreciated in the workplace, they'll be able to ease the mental load that comes with emotional labor. How to build trust in the remote workplace | How to encourage honesty among employees and staffTip #2: Reward your employees for their hard work Performing surface and deep acting can seem less daunting when employees get rewarded for their hard work. Thus, managers should make sure to provide employees with regular tips and raises. This way, management shows that they recognize emotional labor as part of work that demands a lot of effort. And, when it comes to employees, this act will make them feel more appreciated \u2014 and emotional labor will feel less burdensome. Tip #3: Create workplace policy that protects employees Managers should create a specific workplace policy that will protect not only customers but workers as well. This policy should contain clear rules that allow employees more autonomy. For example, workers should not be punished when they express their opinions openly. Besides, such workplace policy should explain employee rights. The policy should also provide guidelines on how employees should react when dealing with unpleasant customers. Creating a workplace policy that empowers employees will surely help workers feel respected in the workplace, which will help them be less emotionally exhausted. Conclusion: Emotional labor doesn't have to be draining Managing your emotions \u2014 by suppressing or evoking them, so they better fit your job role is the gist of emotional labor. When she coined this term, Arlie Hochschild focused solely on managing emotions at the workplace. However, for other researchers, such as Gemma Hartley, the definition of emotional labor expands to non-work-related areas like households. When it comes to emotional labor at the workplace, it's worth noting that employees who perform emotional labor do so by engaging in surface or deep acting. Now, both types of acting require a lot of emotional effort, which is why emotional labor has several key consequences \u2014 such as burnout and depression.

Is there a way to deal with emotional labor? Even though in some jobs emotional labor is inevitable, there are ways to prevent extreme repercussions. Thus, employees should follow these actions: - Let their managers and colleagues know how they feel, - Think about the greater purpose of their work, and - Take regular breaks. On the other hand, it's up to managers to: - Show their employees they trust and support them, - Reward workers for their hard work, and - Create workplace policies that protect employees. This way, workers will be able to alleviate stress and be more content with their work making emotional labor seem less demanding. References - Aung, N., Tewogbola, P. (2019).

To count with the available days for sick leave and vacation for an employee for next month, simply copy and paste the days left for sick leave and vacation from the previous month(e.g. if the \"April\" sheet shows Employee 1 has 19 days left for vacation and 2 days for sick leave, add these numbers to the \"May\" sheet under available). Continue this pattern for each subsequent month. Best for what and who? This template is great when you want to visually track and easily find employee sick leave, personal leave, vacation, and non-working days/public holidays throughout the entire year. Visually tracking this data per day can help you schedule and assign work throughout the year. For example, you and your team will know not to assign a project or task to Lisa Johnson from May 15th to May 25th because you'll be able to see that she is on vacation during this time. In the same line, you'll be able to reconsider scheduling a project deadline for May 4th, because you'll know that the company will have that day off due to a public holiday. \u23ec Download the classic Yearly Vacation, Sick Leave, Personal Leave Tracker Template in Excel Visitor and Appointment Tracker Excel Templates Visitor and appointment tracker templates let you track the casual visitors and official appointees such as clients that enter your company.

But, it has its limitations. Namely, tracking attendance with a template is suitable only if your company has a smaller number of employees, so you can easily track and manually add correct information for everyone. However, perhaps your company has the policy to measure sick leave, personal leave, or vacation time in hours, instead of days. And, perhaps you want more detailed insights into the activities, tasks, and assignments your employees actually engage in while attending work. In such a case, using a time tracking tool that allows the automating tracking of attendance for your team through different projects is the best solution. Clockify is a time tracking software that allows you to easily track time on all company-related \"projects\", including work attendance, break time per day, but also absent days caused by sick leave, personal leave, or vacations. Here's how. How to track attendance with Clockify To track employee attendance in the easiest way with Clockify, simply invite your team to your company workspace, and provide instructions: Each time an employee arrives at the office (or sits down in front of the computer to work from home), he or she should start the timer on", "tokens": 1000, "node_type": "child"}

Here's how. How to track attendance with Clockify To track employee attendance in the easiest way with Clockify, simply invite your team to your company workspace, and provide instructions: Each time an employee arrives at the office (or sits down in front of the computer to work from home), he or she should start the timer on the Time Tracking page of the app. As an alternative, employees can add the time they worked on manually, after they are done with work for the day. Apart from this simple clock-in, clock-out approach, you can also use Clockify to track the tasks and activities your employees engage in while at work. If you're working on multiple work projects, define separate Clockify projects for them, and instruct employees to select and track time on these projects when working on them. To have employees track their breaks, simply define a project called \"Breaks\" and have employees track the time they spend on short breaks or on lunch breaks. Once you define a couple of projects, your employees will also be able to log their hours in a simple timesheet. To streamline your workflow, you can also add specific tasks to projects, write descriptions for each time entry, define tags to specify the type of task being worked on, and more. Later on, you can go to the Reports of the app and see at a glance who worked when, for how long, and on what. You may find the Weekly Report especially useful, as it shows you a simple and easy-to-read breakdown of the times your employees were at work on a weekly basis. How to track absence with Clockify Apart from tracking attendance, you can also easily track absence with Clockify, by creating several suitable projects for this and then having employees track time on them. For starters, you can follow the outline of the listed attendance tracking templates, and create and name separate projects for \"Sick Leave\", \"Vacations\", \"Personal Leave\". Or, depending on the time-off policy and workflow of your company, you can expand on this basic time off data, and have employees track time for \"Half-days\", \"Family Leave\", \"Unpaid Leave\", \"Personal Time\", and more. However you choose to track employee time off, you'll easily be able to create projects for each type of leave in a couple of clicks. Afterward, your employees can track this time just like they would track their work hours: - with a timer - by adding time manually - by adding time in a timesheet If the regular workday in your company is 8 hours, then you should instruct employees to add 8 hours for time off as well. Later on, you'll be able to view and analyze employee absence in the Reports Section of the app, and even compare absences with attendance, if you choose to view a report of all your Clockify", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

A performance review (also known as a performance evaluation or a performance appraisal) is a written assessment that contains all the details about an employee's contributions at work over a given time period. Managers conduct employee evaluations to review the performance of their employees regarding their: - Strengths and weaknesses - Skills and competencies - Ability to meet deadlines - Ability to work in a team - Attendance history Once managers have all the info about employees, they need to provide their workers with feedback. For example, if there are some particular areas for improvement, managers need to let employees know, so that corrections can be made. Performance review: 6 common methods and self-evaluationsTypes of performance reviews When evaluating the work of employees, reviewers can conduct appraisals by analyzing an individual performance over a specific period of time, such as a month or a longer time frame. Speaking of a person performing an appraisal, this is usually a manager or a team lead, but can also be coworkers and employees themselves, in the case of peer reviews and self-assessments. To show you the most common types of performance reviews, we will divide performance appraisals by the following parameters: - Their frequency - The person conducting the review Let\u2019s see what each of these categories entails. Types of performance reviews by frequency When it comes to the frequency of performance appraisals, we can distinguish between: - Monthly performance reviews - Quarterly performance reviews - Mid-year performance reviews - Annual performance reviews There are also weekly or fortnightly performance", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

Types of performance reviews by frequency When it comes to the frequency of performance appraisals, we can distinguish between: - Monthly performance reviews - Quarterly performance reviews - Mid-year performance reviews - Annual performance reviews There are also weekly or fortnightly performance appraisals \u2014 although they\u2019re not as common as the types of reviews listed above. Monthly performance reviews Monthly performance reviews are especially practical when managers need to evaluate the work of: - Newly hired employees \u2014 to review their performance during their first assignments. - Employees working on a new project \u2014 to evaluate the work of all employees involved in a project. - Employees on short-term contracts or freelancers \u2014 to review their work during the limited amounts of time during which they are employed. Monthly performance reviews are a great way to make sure that workers stay on track with project progress and that their work is aligned with the company\u2019s goals. Quarterly performance reviews When doing quarterly appraisals, managers focus on employee performance over three months of the year. And, since there are 12 months in a year, there are four quarters \u2014 four quarterly reviews (Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4). Each quarterly appraisal needs to include metrics such as: - Goals - Targets - Budgets Then, team leads can use these metrics to evaluate their employees. In addition, they can also review employee performance by highlighting employees\u2019 areas of excellence and areas that need improvement. Mid-year performance reviews Mid-year performance appraisals cover a six-month period and represent employee performance over these six months. The key advantage of conducting mid-year reviews is that it gives managers a better overview of: - Employee past performance (over the last six months) \u2014 the tasks and activities that worked well and those that haven\u2019t, as well as the highlights of employee performance. - Plans for the next six months \u2014 the precise methods that will help employees improve their critical areas. Managers can also see employee goals for the next six months along with a precise plan to achieve them. Annual performance review Annual performance appraisals are a great way to evaluate employee work over a year. It\u2019s a summary of all the achievements an employee has managed to accomplish over the past year, as well as suggested areas for improvement. However, this type of review isn\u2019t suitable for all businesses, because it isn\u2019t always easy to sum up an entire year of work into one work performance review. So, instead of evaluating employees once a year, many companies opt for 360 Performance reviews \u2014 which we\u2019ll explain in the next section.

Types of performance reviews by the reviewer Now, when it comes to the person performing a review, it doesn\u2019t always have to be a manager. Here are some other types of reviews that don\u2019t entirely (or at all) include team leads: - 360 Performance review \u2014 managers and coworkers perform such appraisals - Peer review \u2014 teammates evaluate other colleagues - Self-assessment \u2014 employees review their own work 360 Performance review 360 Performance appraisals are reviews that gather information about employees from their managers and coworkers from their team. Aside from employee performance, this type of evaluation focuses on reviewing areas such as: - Accountability and work habits - Trust and honesty - Teamwork - Interpersonal communication - Leadership A 360 Performance review is invaluable because it provides feedback about individual performance from all directions. Peer review Unlike with the 360 Performance review, in a Peer review, teammates are solely the ones who review employee performance. Here are the key areas this review needs to cover: - Ability to work in a team - Ability to collaborate and communicate with other teammates - Trust and respect - Accountability This type of feedback is important because it can reveal particular skills, or strengths and weaknesses that managers wouldn\u2019t be able to figure out themselves. After all, it\u2019s only logical that team members who are constantly collaborating will be able to understand and assess each others\u2019 way of work from a different angle than managers. Self-assessment review A self-assessment review ensures that employees reflect on their performance over a set period of time. When filling out a self-assessment review, employees should think of examples of good and poor performance. Moreover, they also need to figure out what barriers stand in their way of achieving results, and find ways to overcome these barriers. Finally, workers should think about the metrics they\u2019ll use to measure their performance \u2014 and ensure that they\u2019re on track. Why are performance reviews important? Here are the key reasons why job performance reviews are significant for both managers and employees. Performance reviews ensure personal roles are linked with business goals Performance appraisals are significant because they show whether individual roles are aligned with business vision and goals. In simpler terms, it\u2019s important that employees understand the bigger picture \u2014 i.e. how their role within the company affects the company's vision and goals. For example, content writers need to understand that the blog posts they are writing are a vital part of the company\u2019s marketing strategy, which further affects the overall success of a company. So, by creating quality content, content writers are helping increase the visibility of the company and driving more organic traffic to the company\u2019s website, and are thus helping accomplish business goals in the long run.

And, it\u2019s up to managers to make sure that all employees know what their responsibilities and roles are. That way, workers can give their best to accomplish overall targets. And, when appraisals show that employee performance doesn\u2019t contribute to the bigger picture, managers need to let employees know that. When everyone\u2019s on the same page when it comes to job roles and responsibilities, it\u2019s easier both for employees and managers to perform better. Performance reviews provide regular feedback about work Providing employees with regular feedback will help them see what their strengths and weaknesses are. Performance appraisals are a great way to include feedback about someone\u2019s work. Besides, employees will know what is expected of them, so they\u2019ll be able to act accordingly. This also increases transparency within the organization and improves communication among employees and their managers. Performance reviews help workers plan their career better Performance reviews can help employees set precise objectives as a reference point in their career. These objectives will allow employees to develop their skills and advance their career in the long run. In addition, performance appraisals will reveal any areas that need improvement. Then, if needed, employees can request training from their mentors, to gain the ability to reach their set goals. Free goal tracker appPerformance reviews ensure that employees are rewarded for good work When employees work hard and achieve great results, this will be reflected in their performance appraisals. In such cases, managers need to make sure to include attributes like \u201cexceeds expectations\u201d when describing employee performance. As a result, seeing such appraisals will surely motivate employees to continue with the good work. Besides, they\u2019ll know that all their efforts and long hours were worth it.

We\u2019ll guide you through all the essential steps. Step 1: Read employee job descriptions The first step is reviewing job descriptions for each employee. That way, you\u2019ll make sure you know the responsibilities of each team member. Then, it\u2019ll be easier for you to compare employee performance with these benchmarks. Next, write down what employees generally do well and what areas need improvement. Note down the examples that show when employees exceeded their expectations.

Then, it\u2019ll be easier for you to compare employee performance with these benchmarks. Next, write down what employees generally do well and what areas need improvement. Note down the examples that show when employees exceeded their expectations. Step 2: Emphasize exceptional areas The next step is to find out the areas where employees have significantly improved their performance. Try to be specific and use examples if you can. In the case you have previous performance reviews for particular employees, make sure to compare them with the current appraisal. Additionally, if some employees have completed a course, a training, or have earned certifications, be sure to include these details in your performance review. Step 3: Evaluate strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats This step entails using previous appraisals to review employee strengths and weaknesses. Then, think about how these traits have changed since the previous review. You can use the SWOT framework for this step: - S \u2014 strength - W \u2014 weakness - O \u2014 opportunities - T \u2014 threat Evaluating strengths Consider all the strengths of each employee, such as accomplishments and their expertise. For example, sales representatives need to make 20 sales each week. So, if some employees manage to make 30 sales per week, these sales reps are surely exceeding expectations by setting higher standards for themselves. Thus, proactivity is their key strength. Evaluating weaknesses Think about an employee\u2019s weaknesses as well, and include solutions to such issues, if you can. For instance, if you think that some workers need to improve their communication skills, you can suggest having a meeting with this person and brainstorming possible solutions together. Or, an HR team can organize a communication training session for the entire team. Evaluating opportunities Next, find out how employees can use their positive attributes to excel \u2014 i.e. their opportunities. For example, an employee is a quick learner and able to finish tasks on time. This shows managers that they can count on such workers when looking for someone to join a vital project. Evaluating threats Finally, note down possible threats that can happen along the way, so that employees can find a way to prevent them. For example, if workers struggle with communicating their messages clearly, provide them with some practical tips on how to create transparent messages. That way, you\u2019ll increase the chances to prevent any potential misunderstandings. Step 4: Suggest actions that can improve employee performance As their manager, you should empower your employees to enhance their performance, which will allow them to advance their career in the long run. You can recommend particular goals that will be beneficial to your employees, along with ways to accomplish these targets. Just remember that these goals need to be aligned with the company's values and vision. For instance, you can encourage your employees to set SMART goals: - S \u2014 Specific - M \u2014 Measurable - A \u2014 Attainable - R \u2014 Relevant - T \u2014 Time-bound This way, employees will find it easier to set goals for the future.

Additionally, they will have a clearer picture of what their plans for improving performance should look like. How to set SMART goals (+ examples and templates)Step 5: Provide employees with feedback Always be sure to include constructive feedback in your performance reviews. That means that even when employees have some areas that need to be improved, remember to give suggestions on how to improve such areas. For example, what tactics they should use, or whether they should change the way that they perform particular tasks. And, of course, when it comes to areas where employees excel, make sure to highlight these achievements, too. Step 6: Encourage employee input Finally, let your employees know that they have an opportunity to share their thoughts on employee reviews, too. So, if there\u2019s anything they didn\u2019t quite understand, or they\u2019d like to discuss with you, encourage them to do so. It\u2019s vital that employees feel included because, that way, they\u2019ll be more motivated to perform better and accomplish the goals you\u2019ve set out for them. What do you write in an employee evaluation? If you\u2019re wondering how to write a performance review and what areas to include, we\u2019ll now guide you through some vital steps. Here are the most crucial areas employee evaluations should focus on: - Achieving goals - Leadership qualities - Communication skills - Teamwork - Culture and values Let\u2019s explore each area in more detail. We\u2019ll also provide you with the phrases you can use in your appraisals. Achieving goals You need to evaluate whether employees set challenging goals for themselves and how they deal with obstacles that prevent them from achieving these goals. In addition, it\u2019s important to review if employees help other coworkers accomplish their targets, too. When it comes to the exact wording you can use for this area, here\u2019s an idea from the book Effective Phrases for Performance Appraisals by James E. Neal: \"Achieves optimal levels of performance with/for\u2026\" Additionally, when talking about improvement, you can use phrases like: \"Continues to grow and improve\u2026\" and \"...is continuously planning for improvement\u2026\" Leadership qualities To review someone\u2019s leadership skills, you need to consider whether employees take into accounts other people\u2019s ideas when making decisions. It\u2019s also crucial to review if employees are willing to help each other with any work-related problems.

How about the productivity of your team? To learn more about your and the productivity levels of your employees, make sure you all measure your productivity. One way to do so is to use an employee productivity report. To make this task easier, we created free templates for evaluating your own or the productivity of your employees. Before we explore these templates, we'll first explain the main traits of productivity and the difference between productivity in manual and knowledge work. Moreover, we'll go through three ways of measuring productivity. Finally, we'll provide you with free templates you can use to measure employee productivity. You can also share these reports with your colleagues or download them to your computer. Employee Report Templates What is employee productivity and what traits does it include? Employee productivity is a metric that shows an individual employee's output in the workplace. For example, in a toy factory, employee productivity will be represented as the number of toys one employee can make in a specific period of time. To define employee productivity, we need to take into account several significant traits that affect it: - Hours and effort - Bottom line results Hours and effort We all have our working hours. Employees usually work 8 hours per day. But, out of these eight hours, how many hours do they dedicate to crucial work tasks? When evaluating employee productivity, managers need to think about whether their employees spend their work time on important tasks. These tasks are significant because they create value and help employees improve their skills. That's what Cal Newport calls deep work. For example, coding and designing a new logo are examples of deep work. On the other hand, there's also shallow work \u2014 the assignments that don't bring too much value, and workers can perform them even when being distracted \u2014 such as responding to emails or attending meetings. So, it's not just how many hours we spend at work that matters, but how many hours we dedicate to deep work \u2014 this is something leaders should keep in mind when evaluating their employees. Bottom line results Another vital productivity trait is the bottom line result. Leaders should measure employee productivity by reviewing the results of their work. For example, depending on the type of work, bottom-line results can be: - The number of sales made, - The number of blogs written, or - The number of logos designed. Now, we mentioned a toy factory, which is an example of productivity in manual work. However, when it comes to knowledge work, employee productivity includes different qualities. Employee productivity in manual work vs. knowledge work Before explaining the difference between productivity in manual and knowledge work, let's first define what manual and knowledge work are. Manual work entails any kind of mass production, so it's mainly performed in factories, plants, and assembly lines. Employees have all the necessary tools and skills to carry out manual", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

However, when it comes to knowledge work, employee productivity includes different qualities. Employee productivity in manual work vs. knowledge work Before explaining the difference between productivity in manual and knowledge work, let's first define what manual and knowledge work are. Manual work entails any kind of mass production, so it's mainly performed in factories, plants, and assembly lines. Employees have all the necessary tools and skills to carry out manual work. And what about their job description? For instance, factory workers usually deal with activities such as packing products, operating machines, and carrying out inspections of finished products. This type of work focuses on quantity and meeting the minimum quality requirements. On the other hand, in knowledge work, both quality and quantity are considered equally important. Knowledge employees have all the required tools to do their work, and these workers should strive to improve their skills to be better at their work. Knowledge employees work in industries such as education, science, health, law, IT, etc. Their job description usually entails a diverse set of tasks \u2014 especially in the IT sector, where knowledge workers deal with various assignments, depending on their exact job in this field of work. For example, QA testers perform tasks such as reviewing system specifications, analyzing product codes, and reporting bugs to development teams. Measuring employee productivity in manual work To measure employee productivity in manual work, you can use a simple formula \u2014 you divide the units of output by the units of input. The output represents the number of items created or services provided, while input refers to the number of units (work hours, labor, or money). For example, a baker makes 40 croissants (output) in 2 hours (input). By using this formula, we can calculate that she bakes 20 croissants per hour. Measuring employee productivity in knowledge work Now, we cannot apply the above formula in knowledge work \u2014 because this type of work usually involves a wide range of tasks. So, measuring productivity by using output and input won't be easy. For instance, a content writer finishes 2 blog posts (output) in 3 days (input). In this case, the quantity would be 2 articles. But, since this is knowledge work, we need to think about quality, too. It's vital to point out that high-quality content means that blog posts need to be informative and useful for readers, while at the same time easy to read and understand. Moreover, blog posts shouldn't have any grammatical or spelling errors. Lastly, outside factors, such as Google ranking, the number of impressions and clicks, are equally important \u2014 if high, they confirm the quality of the content. Thus, when evaluating the productivity of knowledge workers, we have to consider both quantity and quality, too. How to define tasks in manual and knowledge work? Now, what about defining tasks in both types of work? When it comes to manual work, there's less hassle and complications when defining tasks. For example, for bakers,", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

Now, what about defining tasks in both types of work? When it comes to manual work, there's less hassle and complications when defining tasks. For example, for bakers, the main tasks would involve baking bread and pastry. But, describing tasks can be a bit difficult in knowledge work. That's because knowledge workers deal with various assignments during the day, and some tasks bring more value to their work than others. For instance, for content writers, tasks that bring more value are assignments such as writing or editing a blog post. On the other hand, low-value tasks are attending meetings and answering emails. As you can imagine, considering all the specific traits of knowledge work is crucial when evaluating employee productivity for knowledge workers. What are the 3 ways of measuring productivity? Now that we've explored some basic methods of evaluating productivity in both manual and knowledge work, let's go through some more detailed ways of measuring productivity, such as: - Efficiency and effectiveness measurements - Subjective and objective measurements - Benchmarking employee productivity Efficiency and effectiveness measurements Efficiency means completing your tasks in a quick and organized way. Effectiveness means getting the desired results. Both characteristics are important for your overall productivity. And, both traits are significant when it comes to productivity evaluations. When managers evaluate both the effectiveness and efficiency of their employees, they take into account both the quality (effectiveness) and the quantity (efficiency) of work. Let's take a call center as an example. To measure the efficiency and effectiveness of call center agents, managers should evaluate the number of calls an agent makes with clients. However, it's not just about the quantity (number of calls), but the quality of these calls, too. So, another metric should be customer satisfaction. And it can be set up so that calls that have been reviewed as 7/10 or above are considered effective calls. Productivity vs efficiencySubjective and objective measurements This type of measurement depends on the type of work. When it comes to manual work, the output is always tangible. You can easily calculate the output in a toy factory and measure employee productivity for each worker by having the results in mind. This type of measurement is called objective productivity measurement. There's also subjective productivity measurement, which allows you to evaluate the productivity of knowledge workers. In this case, measuring employee productivity will depend on the industry, the type of tasks workers work on, and other factors. Lastly, there's also self-reporting measurement \u2014 a method that involves employees evaluating themselves.

Benchmarking employee productivity This type of productivity measurement entails setting a point of reference, then comparing employee productivity against this point \u2014 as a way of helping managers understand whether their workers are thriving or falling behind. Benchmarking employee productivity comes in handy, especially in knowledge work. For instance, for a team of content writers, a point of reference can be writing a detailed blog post once per week, by following predetermined content writing rules. What is an employee productivity report? An employee productivity report is a document that keeps track of an individual's or team's productivity. You can create an employee productivity report either manually, by using spreadsheets, or by using software tools. These reports come in handy for employees because they can learn more about their productivity patterns throughout the day, week, or month. Moreover, such reports are quite helpful for managers, too. Team leads can figure out how productive their employees are \u2014 but also if they're overwhelmed with work or if some workers can squeeze in additional tasks. Here's how employees can benefit from using an employee productivity report: - Employees can analyze their own productivity over a particular time frame. - Employees can identify how effective and efficient they are with particular tasks. Furthermore, here are some key perks of using an employee productivity report for managers: - Managers can use these reports as a point of reference when deciding on promotions, performance appraisals, and bonuses. - Managers can compare the employee performance of each worker by reviewing their past and current reports. This way, team leads will know if employees are improving their work over time.

However, since the specifics of the timekeeping system are left up to each member state to figure out \u2014 EU business owners need to be familiar with both the EU and their own country\u2019s regulations to remain compliant. The EU Working Time Directive (1993) Long before timekeeping became a required practice in the EU, certain measures were taken to ensure employees\u2019 health and safety and protect them from being overworked. One of them was the EU's Working Time Directive \u2014 a legislation aimed at regulating working time in EU member states. This piece of regulation introduced specific work hours standards that remain effective even today, decades later. | EU WORKING TIME DIRECTIVE PROVISIONS | | |---|---| | Working time | Employees cannot work longer than 48 hours per week on average over a 4-month reference period (overtime included). | | Daily and weekly rest | Employees must have at least 11 consecutive hours of daily rest and a minimum of 24 hours of uninterrupted weekly rest. | | Breaks | Employees must be provided a break after 6 hours of work. | | Annual leave | Employees have the right to at least 4 weeks of paid leave per year. | | Overtime | Member states may allow individual employees to opt out of the 48-hour week limit (under strict conditions). | | Night work | Night workers mustn't work more than an average of 8 hours per 24-hour period. If they perform dangerous or strenuous work, they must not work longer than 8 hours in any 24-hour period. | As the table above shows, the EU Working Time Directive was developed with both the employees' and employers' best interests in mind. Yet, at the moment of its introduction, the directive didn\u2019t propose a system to ensure employers followed these requirements. That's when an additional provision needed to be introduced. The EU timekeeping requirement (2019) Although the Working Time Directive did change the landscape of work in the EU, it left employers too much wriggle room to mishandle the propositions. That\u2019s when a lawsuit that would alter the course of the EU working standards was filed. It all started when the Spanish subsidiary of Deutsche Bank was discovered underreporting employee hours and underpaying for overtime. Since such activities violated EU labor law set out by the EU's Working Time Directive and Charter of Fundamental Rights, the Spanish trade union filed a lawsuit against Deutsche Bank. Ultimately, in May 2019, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that all EU employers must track their employees' working hours. From then on, employers from all the member states are required to establish an \u201cobjective, reliable, and accessible system\u201d for measuring daily working time. Here are some of the timekeeping provisions EU employers are expected to follow. | EU TIMEKEEPING PROVISIONS | | | Records | Employers are required", "tokens": 1000, "node_type": "child"}

However, individual states are left to determine the specifics concerning the type of timekeeping system and its implementation. What does the EU timekeeping law mean for employers? Since the EU left it up to individual member states to iron out the timekeeping details, certain states have yet to introduce more specific time tracking directives. However, until that happens in each EU member state, employers should focus on implementing a timekeeping system that will first protect workers. As for what is mandated, the ruling currently says employers must have a time tracking system: - To keep track of overtime hours, and - To ensure employees get their obligatory rest periods. Where the ruling is implemented, employees have an easier time winning lawsuits to compensate for overtime. Before the time tracking requirements, employees had to prove their overtime hours to the court. Now, the burden of proof is on the shoulders of the employer, i.e., the employer has to disprove an alleged overtime claim. So, whether you're in a country that has implemented the time tracking ruling or not, it's a lot safer to invest in a time tracking system that allows you to track time accurately and objectively. \ud83c\udf93 How to Choose the Best Time Tracking Software \ud83c\udf93 29 Time Tracking Best Practices Time tracking requirement across EU states Even before the ECJ ruled on introducing a reliable system for keeping track of employees\u2019 working hours, many EU member states \u2014 such as Austria, Croatia, Luxembourg, Hungary, and others \u2014 already had an explicit timekeeping requirement in place. However, most states needed to amend their existing labor laws to ensure compliance with the EU regulations. Let\u2019s take a look at how some of the member states implemented the EU timekeeping requirements. Spain Spain was the first member state to implement the new timekeeping requirement into their Royal-Decree Law in response to the CCOO vs. Deutsche Bank ruling.

Also, since employers are considered responsible for recording working hours, companies could face serious financial penalties in case of irregularities. Greece In June 2021, Greece adopted an employment law that mandates the implementation of an electronic system for employee timekeeping via digital work cards. Employees are now expected to record their attendance by logging the start and end of their workdays. The system is connected to the country's ERGANI platform for employers, meaning that the Greek Labor Inspectorate has access to the data at all times. Denmark As of July 1, 2024, all Danish employers are required to register their employees\u2019 working hours. According to the most recent amendment of the Working Time Directive, Danish employers must implement a timekeeping system that would accurately measure employee working hours. The amendment also states that: - Employers are required to register their employees\u2019 total working hours per day, - Employees need to be able to access the registered information at all times, and - The recorded information needs to be stored for a minimum of 5 years. However, the amendment doesn\u2019t require employers to monitor their workers\u2019 clock-in and clock-out times or stipulate exactly what system they are required to implement. What matters the most is that employees do not work more than 48 hours per week over a period of 4 months. \ud83c\udf93 How to Make an 8-Hour Workday Schedule Work Germany Ever since the German Federal Labor Court ruled that all German employers must record their staff working hours in 2022, time tracking has been an important topic across the country. However, since the 2022 decision did not specify enough details on how exactly the time recording should work, in April 2023, the Federal Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs drafted an amendment to the Working Hours Act. According to the draft, employers would now be required to electronically record their employees\u2019 clock-in and clock-out times and the total number of working hours each day.

Yet, since the bill has not become law yet, it still remains to be seen how the new provisions will be implemented. FAQs about the EU time tracking law If you\u2019re still unsure about the specifics of the EU legal requirements, take a look at the following frequently asked questions. Is time tracking mandatory in France? Time tracking is mandatory in France only for specific groups of workers. If employees have individual working hours (e.g., each team member works a different number of hours), employers are responsible for having a time tracking system in place. This system would record employees\u2019 start and end times, and the total number of hours worked per day. However, if employees follow collective working hours (the entire team works the same number of hours), the employer is only responsible for keeping a record of the whole team\u2019s working time. Does the EU Working Time Directive still apply in the UK? The EU Working Time directive is still valid in the UK even after Brexit. UK employers are still required to follow the maximum working time provisions and ensure their workers work at most 48 hours per week. They must also: - Provide employees a 20-minute rest break after 6 hours of work, - Ensure they take annual leave, and - Comply with other Working Time Directive provisions. Is employee monitoring legal in Europe? Generally speaking, employee monitoring is legal in Europe if there is a legitimate business reason for this action. In other words, such data needs to be necessary for a company\u2019s management and functioning. However, employee monitoring needs to comply with the EU General Data Protection Regulation, and employees need to be informed and consulted about any instance of monitoring. Also, certain member states, such as Portugal, Cypress, and Denmark, have introduced their own regulations regarding employee monitoring. That\u2019s why it\u2019s always best to consult with legal advisors before introducing any new technology for collecting and processing personal information. What are some benefits of time tracking? A time tracking system is not just beneficial for keeping up with the laws regarding working hours in European countries. There are many other benefits of timekeeping for both employees and employers. Some time tracking benefits for employees include the following: - No more overtime without remuneration, - Legal protection from abusive employers, - Better work hours and healthier work-life balance, - Right to digital disconnection needed to truly enjoy the benefits of time-off, and - No more consecutive work shifts (minimum 12-hour break between working hours). Time tracking benefits for employers include the following: - Organized and digitized records that make payroll and salaries more accurate, - Increased", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

Time tracking benefits for employers include the following: - Organized and digitized records that make payroll and salaries more accurate, - Increased transparency and trust between employers and employees, - Improved employee health and productivity, - A better handle on true costs, time sinks, and inefficiencies, and - More accurate quotes and deadlines based on actual historical data. For accurate timekeeping, go for a reliable software Staying compliant with all the timekeeping provisions goes beyond introducing policy changes. You\u2019ll also need to ensure that you have a system in place that can guide you in the right direction. This is where timekeeping software, such as Clockify, comes in. Clockify lets you track all work-related time, including breaks, overtime, and time off. This way, you can quickly spot if your employees\u2019 working time is about to exceed the directed total of 48 hours per week and introduce changes to their schedule. Employees can also report their hours online across multiple devices, which you can later export or print for signing. However, keep in mind that having a time tracking system does not make you automatically compliant with the time tracking law. You\u2019ll need to make sure you\u2019re using the software correctly. That\u2019s why it\u2019s best to consult with your legal advisor before establishing a timekeeping system as this will ensure compliance with the EU timekeeping regulations.

Not only do expense reports underline some of the issues people might have with them, but they also say a lot about the employees who fill them out. The research included in the Wall Street Journal helps distinguish among five different types of employees based on how they approach the expense reporting process: - Expense Report \u2018\u2019Sidestepper\u2019\u2019, - Expense Report \u2018\u2019Martyr\u2019\u2019, - Expense Report \u2018\u2019Payback Artist\u2019\u2019, - Expense Report \u2018\u2019Rookie\u2019\u2019, and - Expense Report \u2018\u2019Grifter\u2019\u2019. So what type are you? Are you an expense report \"Sidestepper\"? The Sidestepper is often reluctant to report their expenses to the employer, no matter how big or small. Let's call the Sidestepper Alice. Alice finds the data she needs to add to her expense report confusing. She believes the process takes too much of her time. She also fears that her employer will start questioning the items in her Report if some of the items turn out pricer than expected. So, Alice the Sidestepper often decides that it's easier not to report the expenses and often pays for them from her own pocket. What to do if you're an expense report \"Sidestepper\"? Take your time to understand your company\u2019s expense policy \u2014 ask for further clarification from the company's bookkeeper or your colleagues when needed. Treat your expense report like a work task, and define the time you'll spend on it on a daily or weekly basis. Then, track the time you spend filling out each Report to make sure you stay within your predefined time limit. Where applicable, use the reports note and description sections to clarify why certain items turned out costlier than expected. Are you an expense report \"Martyr\"?

Then, track the time you spend filling out each Report to make sure you stay within your predefined time limit. Where applicable, use the reports note and description sections to clarify why certain items turned out costlier than expected. Are you an expense report \"Martyr\"? The Martyr often avoids filing for expense reimbursement. But, unlike the Sidestepper, who avoids the process because they are too \"confusing\" or \"stress-inducing,\" the Martyr does so because they feel personally \"close\" to the company and its cause. Therefore, Martyrs treat these business expenses like their own. Let's call the Martyr Peter. Peter the Martyr rarely asks for reimbursements and covers most of his job-related expenses from his own pocket. What to do if you're an expense report \"Martyr\"? The feeling of closeness you have to your company is admirable, but you should still file reimbursement requests for your business-related expenses. Asking for reimbursement is necessary if you want to stay compliant with your company's expense policy. Are you an expense report \"Payback Artist\"? Unlike the Sidestepper and the Martyr, the Payback Artist is overzealous in asking for expense reimbursement. Let's call the Payback Artist Matt. Matt asks for reimbursement for every dollar he spends \u2014 because he wants to pay the company back for something he believes is an injustice toward him. This \"payback\" may be tied to his salary being smaller than he thinks he deserves. Or, it may be tied to Matt thinking his superiors have salaries much bigger than he thinks they deserve. It may also be tied to some rejected expense reimbursement he experienced in the past \u2014 and now he wants to settle that expense indirectly, through other requests. So, Matt, the Payback Artist, decides to file for as many expense reimbursements as he believes are enough before he and the company are square. What to do if you're an expense report \"Payback Artist\"? If you unjustly didn't get approval for a past reimbursement request, don't turn to payback. Sure, it might make you feel better, but it does nothing to stop the problem from happening in the future. Instead, turn the matter over to a higher entity in your company. If you think your salary is unfair, don't up your expense report to make matters even \u2014 try asking for a salary raise, coupled with concrete proof of why you deserve one. You might be pleasantly surprised by the outcome of it. Are you an expense report \"Rookie\"? The Rookie is also overzealous in making sure the expenses listed are in order \u2014 because they generally don't know precisely when and how to ask for a reimbursement. Let's call the Rookie Christina. Christina just got her first job at a prestigious company, and she's still unfamiliar with how the expense policy of her new company works.", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

Let's call the Rookie Christina. Christina just got her first job at a prestigious company, and she's still unfamiliar with how the expense policy of her new company works. It's hard for her to decide what to file a reimbursement claim for. When she travels for business, she books cheap flights and stays in economical hotels because she believes that's the right thing to do. Let's now look at another Rookie \u2014 David. David also just got a job at a prestigious company. However, unlike Christina, David always asks for the most expensive services when on a business trip, because he believes that's what the concept of expense reimbursement is for. So, Christina and David are both Rookies, but in different ways \u2014 she is afraid of overstepping an imaginary boundary, and he treats the reimbursement policy like an invitation to spend money freely. What to do if you're an expense report \"Rookie\"? Study your company's expense policy, and underline the points you don't understand. You can then ask the company's bookkeeper to clarify these points \u2014 or you can ask your colleagues about the general amounts they spend on the items you tend to overspend or underspend on. Are you an expense report \"Grifter\"? The Grifter generally plays loose with the \"business\" part of the phrase \"business expense policy\" \u2014 and tends to also ask for reimbursement for more personal expenses. Let's call the Grifter Annabelle. Annabelle likes to expand the expense policy beyond typical business expenses \u2014 to items that range from babysitting services to new jewelry. But, she is a high-achiever at her company, so the employer generally turns a blind eye to such behavior. So, Anabelle the Grifter is similar to the Rookies David and Christina \u2014 the difference is that she knows her expense policy well, yet she often decides to bypass it. What to do if you're an expense report \"Grifter\"? You might want to be more careful about adding questionable items to your expense reports \u2014 just because you got away with it three times, it doesn't mean you won't get into trouble the 4th time. So, try to keep your expense reimbursement requests within a reasonable amount and purpose. Simplify your expense processing with an Expense tracker Although expense report templates are a nifty way to keep an eye on your expenses, as is the case with all ready-made templates, they might not always be a one-size-fits-all solution. Sometimes you might need to include more detail than you can fit in a premade template, so you\u2019ll find it easier to go for another option that can keep all your costs in one place, and this is where an expense tracker can", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

But, what is an expense tracker? Well, its purpose is to help speed up the process of expense reporting even further. This type of software helps you calculate and keep the costs of your business operations and tasks in one place. You can quickly generate reports from here showing how much you need to be reimbursed for a business-related activity, be it business travel, a client lunch, or a promotional event. Despite it not being a traditional expense report software, you can use Clockify to help facilitate the process of expense reporting even further \u2014 alongside the listed Expense Report Templates. How can Clockify help you speed up expense reporting? In its essence, Clockify is free time tracking software that lets you easily track the time you spend on tasks and projects before automatically calculating how much you need to be paid for your time. But, it can also help you speed up your expense reporting \u2014 if you use Clockify's custom fields. The custom fields feature lets you add a special custom field to your time entries (either for all projects or only for some projects) where you'll be able to: - Add your expenses for each task you track time on, - Specify your mileage on business trips, - Add links to your receipts, and more. Later on, you'll be able to export a Detailed Report of your time results and view your time entries, as well as their specific expenses, mileage, and receipts listed in a CSV or Excel table. Other uses for Clockify in your expense reporting In addition to helping you record your expenses, Clockify can also help you record and see whether the time you spend on the said business tasks is really worth it. This knowledge will really help put the time you spend on certain business tasks in perspective. Perhaps you'll find that the 10 business lunches with clients you arrange per month are literally not worth your time. Here's how you can draw these conclusions with Clockify: - Define the projects you're working on, - Define your project-related tasks, and - Define a specific hourly rate for each of your projects. When you want to take a client out for a business lunch, treat it like a task you'll add to the appropriate project in your project list at Clockify. You can track time on this project-related task by starting a timer and tracking time while you're at the business lunch. Or, you can add the time you've spent", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

In order to be FLSA compliant and avoid unexpected wage and hour lawsuits, all US businesses are required to track time for all non-exempt employees and keep those records for two years. Here are the most important things you need to know about DOL's FLSA timekeeping compliance. What is the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)? The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) are rules set by the US Department of Labor regarding: - Minimum wage, - Overtime pay, - Recordkeeping, and - Youth employment norms. More specifically, the FLSA is in charge of: - Setting minimum wage, - Setting overtime pay, - Supervising and assessing record keeping, and - Laying out standards for youth employment. They apply to all businesses in the US, regardless of their operating sector. Even though businesses need to track their time, the FLSA doesn't insist on a specific timekeeping method, so companies may choose whichever method they prefer as long as it gives accurate records. Here are some common examples of timekeeping methods: - A time clock that records when the staff begin and end their work, - A timekeeper responsible for recording employees' time, or - A time tracking software that tracks employees' work hours and helps with creating timesheets. Who has to comply with FLSA rules and regulations? In terms of employees, the FLSA rules and regulations apply to everyone who is: - A full-time or part-time employee within the private sector, and - A federal, state, or local government employee. In terms of companies and enterprises, the FLSA rules and regulations apply to all who: - Have a yearly gross of $500,000 or more, - Care for the sick, the elderly, or the mentally challenged as their primary area of operation, - Run elementary and secondary schools or institutes that provide higher education, and - Run schools tailored exclusively for gifted children. What is the Fair Labor Standards Act's minimum wage? According to the current FLSA regulations, the minimum wage per hour is: - $7.25 for non-exempt workers who are 20 years of age or older (unless classified into a category specifically exempted from the FLSA), - $2.13 for tipped employees, and - $4.25 for workers under the age of 20 during their first 90 days of employment. Take into account that the minimum wage rate mustn't be lower than these figures. Furthermore, there are exceptions regarding the minimum compensation that apply to workers in certain employment categories under specific circumstances.

Employment at less than the minimum wage is only allowed and regulated with a certificate by the Secretary of Labor. How is the Fair Labor Standards Act's overtime pay calculated? Non-exempt employees are allowed to work overtime, and thus they're compensated for their overtime work. As the term suggests, they are not exempt from the FLSA rules regarding overtime pay. Exempt employees, on the other hand, are free from the FLSA minimum wage and overtime pay. Calculating overtime pay for non-exempt employees The compensation that non-exempt employees receive for overtime work shouldn't be less than 1.5 times their regular pay rates within a 40-hours workweek, with some exceptions. According to the Fair Labor Standards Act, 1.5 times of employee's regular rate is always mandatory for all nonexempt employees who work over 40 hours in a workweek, except for: - Police officers, - Public fire fighters, - Hospital employees, and - Nursing homes employees. Some states also have special exceptions to their overtime pay rules for certain employees (e.g. Washington and California). In such cases, the employee is eligible to receive overtime pay based on the standard that allows higher compensation. Calculating overtime pay for non-exempt employees is fairly simple. For example, if an employee earns $9 per hour and works for 46 hours within a workweek, this is how the employer needs to calculate their payment: - They need to multiply $9 by 1.5 and get $13.5 per each additional hour worked. - Then, they multiply $13.5 by 6 additional hours to get $81 of overtime pay. The regular pay for 40 hours per week (when the hourly rate is $9) is $360, which suggests that $360 of regular pay, plus $81 of overtime pay, equals $441 in total for the entire workweek. Calculating overtime pay for employees paid per commissioned job In order to be exempt from overtime payments, commissioned employees must meet the following conditions: - The employee must work in a retail or service business, - The regular rate of pay must be higher than 1.5 times the minimum wage, and - More than half of the total earnings in a specific period must include commissions. If the employee doesn't meet all of these conditions, they must be paid for all overtime hours 1.5 times the regular rate of pay. If the employee is paid per commissioned job, calculating overtime pay will also start from taking an hourly rate into account.

If the employee doesn't meet all of these conditions, they must be paid for all overtime hours 1.5 times the regular rate of pay. If the employee is paid per commissioned job, calculating overtime pay will also start from taking an hourly rate into account. To find the hourly rate, the employer needs to divide the amount earned for a week with the number of employee hours worked, including overtime. Just like in the previous example, overtime equals 1.5 of the regular rate. For example, if an employee is paid $352 per commissioned job (the amount earned for a week) and they have worked 44 hours within a week (number of hours worked), the breakdown goes as follows: - Divide $352 by 44 hours and get an $8 hourly rate. - Then, multiply $8 by 1.5 which equals $12. So, the employee is entitled to $12 for each overtime hour. In this case, this amounts to $48 for 4 additional hours. This in turn means $400 in total ($352+$48). Calculating the regular rate and overtime pay for salaried employees To calculate the regular rate for salaried employees (those that receive the same compensation every week regardless of the hours worked), you have to divide the salary by the actual hours the employee has worked within a week. For example, if an employee's actual hours worked differ from week to week, but they receive a flat compensation of $450, the breakdown for a 45-hour week goes as follows: - Divide $450 by 45 hours worked which equals a $10 hourly rate. The employee receives half of the $10 as compensation for each overtime hour. In this case, for 5 overtime hours, the employee earns $25 ($10/2=$5; $5 x 5 hours=$25). - In total, that's $475 for the entire week ($450+$25). The hourly rate and the final amount for salaried employees will vary depending on the total hours worked. The higher the total hours, the lower the hourly rate will be, which in turn, will impact the overtime payments. Working off the clock: why it's illegal and how to prevent it Exempt and non-exempt employees When it comes to applying the FLSA guidelines, there is a difference between exempt and non-exempt employees. To be precise, whether someone will be classified as exempt or non-exempt may depend on: - The compensation offer (how much the employee is paid), - The manner in which they're paid (salary or hourly pay), and - The nature of the role (the type of work the employee performs). To sum up, you can determine whether an employee has an exempt or non-exempt status by their salary level, salary basis, and job duties.

For more detailed information on the professions exempt from overtime payments and minimum wages, check out the US Department of Labor. Employees who are exempt from overtime payments The following list of employees are classified as exempt from overtime protections, even if they work for more than 8 hours per day (or 40 hours per week): - Sales workers using cars, truck, boats and other transportation vehicles to sell products, - Commissioned sales employees in retail and sales organizations, - Drivers, driver's helpers, loaders, and mechanics working for a motor carrier, - Agricultural employees working on small farms, - Taxicab drivers and other transportation workers driving locally, - Movie theater workers (actors, composers, dancers, and other creatives), and - Certain media workers (presenters, news editors, narrators, opinion columnists or commentators). Even though the rules vary by state, workers in any of the above classifications are usually considered exempt from receiving overtime pay. Furthermore, the Fair Labor Standards Act excludes from receiving overtime compensation any person who is technically not considered to be an \u2018employee.' Such individuals are those who: - Occupy a public elective office or agency, - Work as a member of the personal staff in public elective office, - Perform duties and services on a policy-making level, - Serve as an immediate advisor to the designated office holder, and - Work in the legislative branch of the government. Should I work overtime without pay? Recordkeeping rules for exempt employees By definition, exempt employees are not paid by the hour but earn fixed salaries. This includes jobs where it's required to: - Be discreet and make independent judgments on various matters, - Be in control of at least two employees, - Employ, dismiss or give promotions to employees, and - Possess specialized expertise and education. But even though these employees may be exempt from the FLSA regulations, employers still need to keep records on their: - Workweek duties (24 hours within a day, for 7 days a week), and - The time of the day and the day of the week when the workweek begins.

Although salaried employees earn fixed payments that are not determined by the hours they've worked, a certain daily routine is expected. To make it official, the FLSA requires information on the time and day of the week when the workweek begins. For example, some companies work on Saturdays but not on Mondays, so they start their workweek on Tuesdays. Additionally, some workers start at 9 a.m. It's also important to document the following information: - The wages employees receive for certain periods, - The employee's personal information (full name, address, gender, date of birth if younger than 19, and social security number), - Date when the employee receives payment, and - Information on what period the payment covers. The importance of tracking employee hours for exempt employees For exempt employees, it's also beneficial to keep track of employee hours in order to: - Add additional accountability for employees. Salaried employees can also benefit from tracking their own work hours since it gives them a better control of their tasks, which in turn promotes accountability within an organization. - Have accurate information on who worked overtime, and how long the overtime was. This will help you: - Identify whether you should hire additional employees in order to minimize the overtime hours, - Find out whether you should introduce an app to automate some processes that are contributing to overtime hours, and - Calculate overtime pay, in accordance with the FLSA requirements. Recordkeeping rules for non-exempt employees According to the FLSA, all employees that earn less than $11.38 per working hour (or $23,600 per year) are not exempt (not salaried), so they must be classified as hourly employees. The same rules apply to certain types of jobs. For example, in tech jobs, if an employee is making less than $27.63 per working hour (or $57,470 per year), they must also be classified as hourly employees. This type of employees require recordkeeping on information such as: - Employee personal information, - Day of the week, and time of the day when their work starts, - The date when the employee's payment is sent, and - The period the payment covers. There are also non-exempt salaried workers who receive annual compensation, but they are still not eligible to be released from the FLSA regulations regarding overtime, and minimum wages. Employers also have to provide: - The exact amount and the basis on which the employee's hours are paid (e.g., hourly or weekly rates), - The rates for overtime earnings for the workweek (specifying whether the compensation is hourly, daily, weekly, or per individual job/project), - The wages", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

How long are companies required to keep wage records? According to FLSA requirements, companies are required to keep wage records for a minimum of 2 years. The information they need to keep record of includes: - The key employment and earnings information, - Records on billing, order, as well as shipment, - Records listing and explaining additions and deductions to the arranged wages, - Straightforward tables showing everyone's wage rates, and - Straightforward schedule showing work time. Apart from this information, it's also vital to keep the following records for a minimum of 3 years: - Payroll records, - Employee bargaining agreements, - Sales records, and - Purchase records. Do you need to track time for exempt and non-exempt employees? Regardless of whether your employees are categorized as exempt or non-exempt, time tracking may still be necessary because it provides numerous benefits for both categories. However, if your employees are non-exempt, this requirement is especially important. On the other hand, exempt workers are not required to keep track of their working hours. However, even if an employee is not subject to the FLSA timekeeping requirements, it is still beneficial to track their work hours. Time tracking gives them detailed insights into the business \u2014 it helps them: - Determine billable hours, - Manage projects efficiently, - Calculate the cost of their services, - Record time offs, and more. As far as employers are concerned, they may want to maintain records on time spent working for exempt employees in case an employee doesn't show up at work. Time tracking will help them prove that the individual failed to comply with their hourly threshold. So, even though tracking salaried employees' hours is not mandatory by law, it is considered legal. All in all, some companies want to invest in an employee time tracking system because they simply want to monitor attendance, while others want to keep time records in case a certain employee doesn't meet the exemption requirements.

FLSA timekeeping requirements In order to be compliant with the FLSA timekeeping requirements, it's important to keep track of employees' hours worked. When it comes to the timekeeping itself, there are no actual limitations to the timekeeping method used. As we mentioned above, the only requirement is that you must provide precise, correct, and detailed data. Each company can choose the tool most suited for their workers: - A time clock. Employees insert a slip of paper card in the time clock. The time clock then prints day and time information on the employee's card. - A timekeeper. With this method, employers check and authorize all the working hours (timesheets) of hourly and non-exempt employees. - A timekeeping software. With timekeeping software, each employee records their time individually. They log in the start and end times for each activity, indicating when they arrived at and left work. The recorded data must be precise. For example, if they arrived at 7:56 a.m. and left at 5:02 p.m. the time should be recorded as such. Companies must keep precise records of the hours worked by non-exempt employees. These records must be kept daily and include: - The employee's arrival time to work, - Employee's unpaid break time (start and end times), including lunch, - The time in the day the employee stops working for the day, and - The total number of hours worked for each day. Does FLSA allow time clock rounding? The FLSA allows time clock rounding, usually for a period of 15 minutes (a full quarter hour): - If the time entry clocked between 1 and 7 minutes, the time is rounded down and excluded from the report on time worked completely. - If the time entry clocked between 8 and 14 minutes, the time is rounded up and included in the report on time worked as 15 minutes. - The time worked can be also rounded to smaller numbers, such as the nearest 6 minutes or 10 minutes. It's important that the employees average out this time rounding. They should avoid always rounding only up or down but rather combine the two practices for more accurate time results. Also, bear in mind that the FLSA doesn't strictly require time tracking for exempt employees. How to minimize mistakes in timesheets General working rules and employee rights Adjacent to the Fair Labor Standard Act , the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (EPA) preserves equal rights and employment opportunities for both men and women.

For more information on occupations forbidden for all minors under 18 years of age, please check the Fair Labor Standard Act regarding child labor regulations. What happens if you disregard the FLSA requirements? To be compliant with FLSA, you must always pay at least minimum wages, compensate for all overtime hours, and classify employees properly with exempt or non-exempt status. If an employer in any way violates the FLSA's overtime or wage regulations, they might risk a lawsuit. That's why it's important to understand the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act and keep in mind everything that employers need to do to maintain FLSA compliance. What are FLSA violations? Here are the most common violations of the Fair Standard Labor Act: - Misclassification of employees. Businesses should avoid misclassifying non-exempt employees as exempt. Failure to comply will result in fines and back pay to employees. - Mixing up salaried workers with hourly workers. Even employees who get flat-rate compensation are not automatically excluded from receiving overtime payments. On the other hand, those paid by the hour are non-exempt from the FLSA regulations. - Unpaid overtime hours. If the worker is doing any type of work for the company or client outside regular business hours, they should be paid for their overtime work. - Break of overtime pay agreements. Disregarding the FLSA rules regarding overtime pay by forcing employees to sign such an agreement is also considered a violation. In case an employer violates the FLSA minimum wage and overtime regulations, an employee may be able to receive back pay or an equal amount of the wages in liquidated damages. Additionally, a 2-year statute of limitations (the period in which employees can claim unpaid overtime or minimum compensation) applies for unpaid minimum wages or overtime compensation.

Additionally, a 2-year statute of limitations (the period in which employees can claim unpaid overtime or minimum compensation) applies for unpaid minimum wages or overtime compensation. However, if the employer willfully violated the provisions of the Act, a 3-year statute of limitations will apply. A federal court jury determines willfulness for this purpose, but the employee must provide strong evidence in order to prove that the employer purposefully violated the act. What's not required and covered by the FLSA? Most businesses are subject to the FLSA, and they are obliged to make sure their employees are aware of the FLSA rules as well. The rules must be posted in the workplace for everyone to see. In some cases, certain employers are not exempt from the FLSA requirements, while their employees are exempt. Such an example are airline employees who are not owed any compensation for working off-clock hours. However, these employees get fair monthly compensation in spite of their extra responsibilities. Additionally, independent contractors and freelancers are not technically considered employees, therefore, they are exempt from FLSA wage and overtime regulations. The matters not required or covered by the FLSA are the times spent on: - On holidays (federal or other), - On vacations, - On sick leave, and - On coffee and smoking breaks or meals (though some states have break requirements). Although it's a usual practice for employers, the FLSA also does not require them to offer: - Raises in pay, - Compensation for holidays, - Compensation for daily commuting to work, - Extra pay due to break of employment contract, - Higher pay for work during less desirable hours and days (second or third shift or even weekends), and - A reason or notification for dismissing an employee. The FLSA also states that employers are free from making immediate payments to dismissed employees. Rather, they can wait till the next payroll period to issue the final paycheck to the departing employee (regardless of their exempt or non-exempt status). However, some states require companies to pay employees' salaries on the last day of employment or within the next 72 hours (such as California). Additionally, whether employees should receive compensation for unused holiday time or sick leave days upon termination is a matter of state laws. Are there any other matters not prescribed by the FLSA? Employees 16 years of age and older may choose to work any number of hours per day or days in a certain week because there are no specific restrictions. However, any work that exceeds over 40 hours per week will be regarded as overtime and should be compensated as such. There are certain state laws that regulate child labor.

Or maybe you\u2019re ready to enter into new markets or open up branches in new areas? However, you don't know the size of your market, or how the market will be evolving in the following years. To identify how your business would work in different future situations, you should use a forecasting model. Forecasting models take into account the following: - The events that you\u2019re trying to forecast, - The type of information that is available to you, and - The level of accuracy of your results. However, it\u2019s important to understand how to implement the different types of forecasting models, but also to figure out which model is the most appropriate for a certain situation or problem. Apart from forecasting models, in this article, we'll cover the top two financial forecasting methods \u2014 quantitative and qualitative. We\u2019ll also mention some forecasting tools and how they can facilitate your future projections. What is forecasting? According to the PMBOK guide, \u201ca forecast is an estimate or prediction of conditions and events in the project\u2019s future, based on information and knowledge available at the time of the forecast.\u201d We may use forecasts in various situations. For example, in finance, companies use financial forecasting to project employee\u2019s wages or set the annual budget. On the other hand, in stock trading and investing, forecasting is used to predict the future market price and performance. Moreover, in a business setting, forecasting can help business analysts study the impact of certain changes in the working environment (such as adjusting business hours). Another type of forecasting is weather forecasting, which predicts future atmospheric changes for a certain area and time, or changes on the Earth surface, based on meteorological observations. In this blog post, we\u2019ll stick with the financial forecasting. What is financial forecasting? Financial forecasting refers to projections made about the future performance of a company in order to estimate how current trends and business metrics will affect the financial position of the company. This can be done by exploring historical information regarding business performance (sales, revenue, or expense figures) as well as current business trends, and other important business variables. Now, why do we need financial forecasting in the first place? Financial forecasting focuses on overcoming business challenges regarding strategy planning processes, including: - Hiring, - Budgeting, and - Expenses. Companies use forecasting to determine if their expectations align with the possible outcomes. In other words \u2014 forecasting helps them make predictions about how current business and market trends (revenue, costs, consumers, demographics, etc.) will affect the company\u2019s performance or operations. Why does your company need forecasting? Forecasting is an important part of business planning and operations because it helps businesses estimate their financial situation. With forecasting, companies can analyze current and past data in order to make predictions about future trends and changes. Since business decisions are based on current market conditions and forecasts about future events, stakeholders will be more comfortable", "tokens": 1000, "node_type": "child"}

With forecasting, companies can analyze current and past data in order to make predictions about future trends and changes. Since business decisions are based on current market conditions and forecasts about future events, stakeholders will be more comfortable in making informed decisions and developing better business strategies. For example, forecasts may help you decide whether to fund a specific project, increase the staffing, or estimate the annual budget. Top benefits of forecasting Let\u2019s see how forecasting can help your business succeed: - Forecasting helps in setting goals and plans ahead of time \u2014 Analyzing data and statistics helps businesses better evaluate their progress and adapt business operations accordingly. - Forecasting helps in allocating a business budget \u2014 A forecast will give you estimates about the amount of revenue or income that is expected in a future period. This, in turn, helps companies get insight into where to allocate their budget. - Forecasting helps in predicting market changes \u2014 Data and projections help companies make better adjustments to their strategies and improve operations in order to meet current market trends. This, in turn, helps them stand out from the competition. To sum up, forecasting is an absolute necessity for any business because it helps you: - Plan for both short and long term future, - Invest your money wisely, - Expand into new markets, - Use real-time data, - Improve collaboration between team leaders, and most importantly, - Plan the next steps for your business. There are various tools that help businesses get better insight into how operations and processes currently work, and find out what needs to be changed or improved. We will mention a few forecasting tools below. Forecasting method vs. forecasting model Sometimes, the terms forecasting method and forecasting model are used interchangeably, however we want to point out that these terms are completely different. In fact, a forecasting method uses mathematical calculations (created for a specific purpose) that does not elaborate on what actually happens in the data, but rather it is solely used to produce forecasts, with or without a forecasting model. On the other hand, a forecasting model breaks up the data into a structure and allows you to examine the process further. Given the rising competition and volatile customer loyalty, it has become challenging for businesses to work out any reasoning behind certain events. For that reason, forecasting models can be used to change and control different business variables and give a clearer picture of the company\u2019s future. Many organizations employ forecasting models to predict various business metrics including sales, profits, consumer behavior, supply and demand, and then set yearly goals. For example, forecasting models can help you understand whether your marketing strategies are effective or whether your sales are struggling. In addition, they help businesses allocate their resources properly and", "tokens": 1000, "node_type": "child"}

In addition, they help businesses allocate their resources properly and plan the upcoming period of time regarding the aforementioned business metrics. What is forecasting in project management? What are the two main forecasting methods? Businesses can choose between different types of forecasting methods, including: - Quantitative forecasting methods, and - Qualitative forecasting methods. Quantitative methods of forecasting In order to make realistic and accurate forecasts, quantitative methods include mathematical processes such as: - Algebra, - Permutations and combinations, - Set theory, - Matrix algebra, and - Integration. In addition, mathematical techniques such as linear programming, dynamic programming, and inventory control can also help decision-makers guide their business strategies. Quantitative methods also include statistical processes such as: - Standard deviation, - One factor analysis of variance, - Multi-factor analysis of variance, - Two sample t-test for equal means, - Autocorrelation, and - Hypothesis test. So, rather than basing the results on opinion and intuition \u2014 quantitative methods implement readily available data to interpret results. These methods are usually used to make short-term predictions by analyzing older, raw data. Finally, quantitative methods can be further divided into: - Time-series forecasting models \u2014 Examine past patterns in the data in order to predict future patterns. Examples of time-series models include: straight-line method, moving average, exponential smoothing, and trend projection. - Associative models (causal models) \u2014 The variable that is being forecasted is associated with other variables, thus, the projections are built on that relationship. Examples of causal models include: simple linear and multiple linear regression. Qualitative methods of forecasting Unlike quantitative methods, qualitative methods are subjective in nature and rely largely on: - Judgments, - Expert opinions, - Intuition, - Emotions, or - Personal experiences. These types of forecasting methods do not implement any mathematical calculations, and are mostly used when the historical data is too narrow or not expected to be followed in the future. Qualitative methods are also used when the available data cannot be projected into numerical analysis, or when the trends and habits are constantly changing. Qualitative forecasting methods can be further classified into 5 forecasting models: - Market survey, - Sales force opinion, - Delphi method, - Visionary forecasting, and - Panel consensus. We will explain these types of forecasting models in further details below. Types of quantitative forecasting models The entire range of forecasting models is enormous and is growing rapidly every day. As we mentioned earlier, quantitative forecasting methods are based on mathematical or numerical values, and they are objective in nature. Thus, the types of forecasting models under this category rely on mathematical computations and calculations, using data from past company operations.

Thus, the types of forecasting models under this category rely on mathematical computations and calculations, using data from past company operations. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the different types of quantitative forecasting models. Bear in mind that these models are basic (there are also some more advanced models), however they can all help you forecast how future trends will change in the forthcoming years. Time-series forecasting models Time-series is a popular forecasting model which explores past company behavior to forecast future company behavior (consumer behavior, sales behavior, etc.). This type of forecasting model uses historical data in terms of hours, weeks, months, and years to come at a point in the future based on these past values. Time-series uses information gathered over several years to analyze sales velocity based on the business needs. Based on those figures, you can create future forecasts using mathematical formulas. There are several models of completing time-series forecasting which will help you formulate future estimations. The subtypes below are all examples of time-series forecasting models: - Straight-line method, - Moving average model, - Exponential smoothing model, and - Trend projection model. Let\u2019s find out more about each one of them. #1 Straight-line method The straight-line method is a time-series forecasting model that provides estimates about future revenues by taking into consideration past data and trends. For this type of model, it\u2019s important to find the growth rate of sales, which will be implemented in the calculations. For example, the annual growth rate of a company can be fixed (6%) over the past 5 years. Consequently, the company anticipates that the growth will continue at 6% over the next couple of years. Using this information, the company can make accurate forecasts about its future decisions for the following years. This will help businesses predict how growth might affect the available data. So, if your company has a continuous growth rate, the straight line forecast can help you get an idea of the ongoing growth at the same rate. Aside from revenue predictions, this model can also be used to predict additional business needs in order to make quick financial decisions. #2 Moving average model The moving average model is similar to the straight-line forecasting, except that it\u2019s often used to predict short-term trends (such as daily, monthly, quarterly, or half-yearly intervals). Companies use the moving average model when they need to forecast sales, revenue, profit, or other important business metrics. With regards to calculating future revenue, for example, the model focuses on observing the past and current revenues (i.e., the average number of the revenues in a given time period) to predict future outcomes. This type of forecasting model is useful when calculating", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

With regards to calculating future revenue, for example, the model focuses on observing the past and current revenues (i.e., the average number of the revenues in a given time period) to predict future outcomes. This type of forecasting model is useful when calculating the performance of a specific metric within a certain time limit. For example, if you want to forecast the sales for the upcoming month, you may take the averages of the previous quarter. This will help you identify the demand during peak selling periods. Here\u2019s how you can do the calculations to get the moving average: A1 + A2 + A3 \u2026 / N A = Average for a specific period N = Total number of periods Let\u2019s say you want to calculate the moving average of sales figures for a period of 4 years (2019-2022) taking 2 years at a time (a two-year moving average). You would need to find averages for the following data subsets: 2019-2020, 2020-2021, and 2021-2022. | Year | Sales ($M) | |---|---| | 2019 | 4 | | 2020 | 7 | | 2021 | 6 | | 2022 | 5 | So, how would you calculate the moving average of sales with the above data set over a period of 4 years? In order to find the average sales value for all 4 years, you will need to include all the 4 total numbers of sales, and then divide them by 4. (4M + 7M + 6M + 5M) / 4 = 5.5M Then, we get a moving average of $5.5 M. #3 Exponential smoothing model Similar to the moving average, exponential smoothing is another time-series forecasting model which can be used to predict new values by using a set of weighted averages based on past observations. Exponential smoothing helps to predict the future by using past company data. The weights start declining exponentially with past observations in order to predict the upcoming period. To put it simply, if the observation is a more recent one \u2014 the associated weight is higher. This means that more weight is given to recent values instead of past values. New forecasts are predicted by including the past forecast and the percentage of value (the difference between the current and the past forecast). The idea behind this model is to attribute importance to more recent values in the series \u2014 when observations become older, past values get exponentially smaller. How to create a project timeline #4 Trend projection model The trend projection model works best in situations where you could work out the future influence of certain variables (dependent or independent) based on its past behavior. The model examines past events in order to identify patterns and trends that could recur frequently. Trend projection can be used to forecast future activity since it considers that all factors involved in past trends", "tokens": 1000, "node_type": "child"}

The model examines past events in order to identify patterns and trends that could recur frequently. Trend projection can be used to forecast future activity since it considers that all factors involved in past trends will continue in the future as well. The model requires long and reliable time-series data which is arranged in chronological order for evaluation. By identifying the patterns of trends, the company will be able to get a vision of the future. Consequently, once the trend has been identified, it will be able to predict future demand. Associative (causal) forecasting models According to associative or causal forecasting models, the forecasted variable is interconnected to other variables in the business system. Therefore, the forecast projections rely on these associations. Associative models are an advanced way to forecast your sales because they implement specific mathematical calculations to identify the connection between different variables that can affect your business activity. The subtypes below are all examples of causal models: - Simple-linear regression model, - Multiple linear regression model. #1 Simple linear regression model The simple linear regression is a type of associative forecasting model that provides a more detailed context to your forecast by examining how the independent variable is correlated to the dependent variable. The dependent variable is the predicted value (e.g. sales), and the independent variable (e.g. profit) guides the expected value of the dependent variable. Simple linear regression can be visualized on a graph by portraying one metric on the X axis, and the other one on the Y axis. Here\u2019s the formula for calculating simple linear regression: Y = BX + A Y = dependent variable (predicted value) B = the slope of the regression line (measure of its steepness i.e the ratio of the rise to the run, or rise divided by the run) X = independent variable A = Y-intercept (the point on the Y-axis by which the slope of the line sweeps) Apart from identifying the relationship between sales and profits, it can also demonstrate the rate of increase and how that rate varies in order to help you find ways to maximize profit. Calculating the simple linear regression is a tedious process, so you might want to use statistical programs to help you analyze the data. #2 Multiple linear regression model As its name suggests, the multiple linear regression model follows the same approach \u2014 i.e. makes the same assumptions as the simple linear regression \u2014 except that it applies it to a number of different business variables. So, when business performance is influenced by more than one variable, this model allows you to explore the relationship between two or more independent variables and one dependent variable. This will help you get a clear picture of the situation and a more accurate", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

This will help you get a clear picture of the situation and a more accurate forecast. For example, multiple linear regression can be used to determine daily cigarette consumption, which can be predicted by independent variables such as smoking duration, starting age of smoking, type of smoker, etc. Or when the margin for a certain product is affected by variables such as labor cost, materials, machine efficiency, etc. However, it can be difficult to perform a multiple regression by hand as these models are complex, especially when there are too many variables involved, so you\u2019ll likely need statistical software. Types of qualitative forecasting models Another method of forecasting is qualitative forecasting. Qualitative forecasting methods are different from quantitative methods because they\u2019re subjective and intuitive in nature. They are based on the opinion and judgment of consumers and experts. In addition, qualitative methods use factors such as demand trends and seasonality to create more accurate forecasts. They can only be used if past data isn\u2019t readily available. All the forecasting models below belong to the category of qualitative forecasting methods. #1 Delphi method The Delphi method is a type of forecasting model that involves a small group of relevant experts who express their judgment and opinion on a given problem or situation. The expert opinions are then combined with market orientation to come up with results and develop an accurate forecast. The Delphi method is performed in such a way that each expert is questioned individually to gather their insights. This helps to prevent bias and ensures that the company\u2019s forecast is based solely on their own expert opinion. Furthermore, other employees or outsourced parties collect, summarize, and analyze experts\u2019 responses. They may pose additional questions to the participants who can then reconsider their original responses in order to come up to a meeting point or final consensus that would be beneficial to the company. Highlights of Delphi method Some of the highlights of this model include: - Freedom of expression \u2014 Since each expert is questioned individually, they have the freedom to express their own opinion without feeling peer pressure, - Ability to make up their mind and give a second thought \u2014 The experts can change their opinion and provide additional information in case they have reassessed the problem, - Consistent feedback \u2014 After each round, the participants are informed about the opinions of other group members and then make discussions, and - Quantitative results \u2014 This type of model is qualitative in nature, however there is possibility to analyze the results quantitatively. When to use Delphi? The Delphi method can be used to: - Predict trends in sales, - Forecast outcomes", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

When to use Delphi? The Delphi method can be used to: - Predict trends in sales, - Forecast outcomes in economic development, - Identify risks and opportunities, - Create work breakdown structures, and - Compile a report from opinions. Other situations where the Delphi method makes sense is when you: - Want to gather subjective statements from a larger group, - Find it difficult to perform a face-to-face discussion due to the group size, - Need to retain the anonymity of the participants, and - Feel there is a dominant person in the group who could interfere with the discussion. #2 Market research model Market research is a qualitative forecasting model that evaluates the performance of a business\u2019s products and services by interviewing potential customers about them. Their reactions and responses are recorded, and then they\u2019re analyzed in order to come up with a sales forecast. This model can be performed by staff members or third-party agencies (specialized in market research) by: - Telephone, - Opinion poll, - Personal interviews, or - Questionnaires. Some examples of market research strategies include: - Focus groups, - Consumer surveys, or - Product testing. However, the strategies might be adapted based on the current market conditions and challenges. These techniques are used to gather valuable insights from consumers so that the company understands which products or services to continue launching and which ones need to be revised. Highlights of market research The market research model can help companies: - Create consumer-oriented marketing policies, - Study marketing problems in order to come up with a solution, - Minimize the gap between consumers and manufacturers, - Introduce new products, - Identify potential markets, and - Choose marketing methodologies. When to use market research? The market research model can be used: - Before the launch of a new product or service, - Once a product or service has been launched in order to find out if it\u2019s been accepted, or - As a continuous plan that will help businesses get information about its market standing. Conducting market research is also beneficial when you need to: - Estimate the market size, - Define potential customers, - Find out why sales are declining, or - Support business growth. #3 Panel consensus model Panel consensus (also called expert opinion) is a qualitative forecasting approach where experts or employees from all levels of an organization (from low-level to top-level) discuss a product or service. The members act like a focus group, expressing their thoughts and recommendations in order to develop a forecast. Anyone can speak up during the discussion, however, sometimes lower-level employees may feel intimidated to express their opinion due to their lack of market knowledge. This is one of the drawbacks of", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

The members act like a focus group, expressing their thoughts and recommendations in order to develop a forecast. Anyone can speak up during the discussion, however, sometimes lower-level employees may feel intimidated to express their opinion due to their lack of market knowledge. This is one of the drawbacks of this model. On the other hand, the forecasting process involves a high number of participants, therefore, the outcome would be more balanced and reliable compared to an individual person\u2019s opinion. The meeting will end once a consensus has been reached. Highlights of panel consensus Some of the highlights of the panel consensus model include the following: - Members from all levels within an organization can establish the forecast, - A large number of ideas can be presented based on each individual\u2019s knowledge, and - A further panel of five top managers is required to come up with a final decision. When to use panel consensus? The panel consensus model can be used: - In the absence of appropriate data for forecasting, - For short-term projections, or - For department-specific forecasts. Other examples where panel consensus may be appropriate is when companies need: - To identify which products are being returned most often and why, - To get insights what customers are looking for, - To detect new trends at an early stage, or - To forecast new product sales in the market. #4 Visionary forecast model The visionary forecasting model is based on personal opinions, judgements, and insights of a relevant and experienced individual. The projections are backed up by data, information, and facts in order to predict future scenarios. When available, historical analogies can also be used to hypothesize potential future forecasts. In other words, the \u2018visionary\u2019 prophesies a set of future events by examining past events and developments. Therefore, this model is subjective and non-scientific in nature, and is solely based on an individual's guesswork and imagination. The only downside of visionary forecasting is that there might be a confirmation bias because visionaries may only look for evidence that supports their own beliefs and disregard any contradicting evidence. Highlights of visionary forecast The visionary forecasting model is: - Characterized by the vision of the expert, - Based on intuitive judgment and opinion, and - Backed up by subjective probability estimations. When to use visionary forecast? The visionary forecast model can be used to: - Study the market environment, - Estimate the sales of a new product, - Anticipate and track the progress of a new product, or - Predict recent trends in new market conditions. Additionally, this model can be used in the absence of historical data. Some steps in the business planning process do not require the use of historical data (analyzing the current financial situation, studying the company\u2019s competition, making future scenarios, or using existing industry trends), so this model could come in handy. #5 Sales", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

When estimating future demand, the company may decide to collect information from the salesperson that would help in determining customer\u2019s needs and predicting the sales in a certain region and given time period. According to the sales force composite model, the sales agent better understands the needs of the customers since they interact with them on a regular basis. This information will help in adjusting business operations in order to meet the client\u2019s needs and maximize sales. The sales person is questioned about the experience and satisfaction of the customers with the company. This model is easy to conduct, since it only requires an appointment with salesforce experts. Each person gives their own opinion about what they expect to sell in their specific region. Highlights of sales force composite Some of the highlights of sales polling are the following: - The personal knowledge of the sales force can be used in favor of the company, - The model is reliable since it involves a large population sample, and - The sales staff has direct interaction with the customers. When to use sales force composite? The sales force composite model can be useful when you need to: - Make shorter-range forecasts for more accurate sales estimates, - Get an opinion on sales trends, - Get more accurate insights based on the experience of sales staff, - Estimate the sales of new products, promotions or strategies, or - Forecast the entire market, but also individual areas and territories. How to choose the right forecasting techniques? Many forecasting techniques (or methods) have been developed over the years so it becomes challenging for managers to select a proper technique for a particular situation. That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential to understand the possibilities of each method and how they can help when forecasting a specific problem or situation. There are some key considerations that need to be taken into account when choosing a forecasting method and model. The following factors influence which forecasting method and model will be used: - The context of the forecast, - The relevance and availability of data, - The degree of accuracy required, - The time period available for analysis, and - The costs or benefits of the forecast to the company. However, before selecting the method and the subsequent model, you will also need to consider the purpose of the forecast and what variables should be included. These considerations will help the forecaster choose the", "tokens": 1001, "node_type": "child"}

On the other hand, long-term goals refer to a more distant future and require more planning than short-term goals. They typically take 3-5 years to achieve, or longer. What is goal setting and how can it help you? Goal setting is the process of taking active steps in order to achieve your goals, that is, your desired outcomes. It includes the development of a plan you\u2019ll need to follow to reach your goals. Goal setting is important because it lays the foundation for everything you need to do to achieve your goals. It also helps you: - Measure your progress towards your goals, - Increase your motivation, and - Direct your efforts towards what\u2019s most important. What are SMART goals? SMART goals are objectives that are: - Specific, - Measurable, - Attainable, - Relevant, and - Time-bound. SMART goals are often used as a goal-setting framework because they cover all the essential aspects of a goal you should consider to reach your goals successfully. How to set SMART goals (+ examples and templates)What are the 5 R\u2019s of goal setting? Besides using SMART goals, another way to set effective goals is to follow the 5 R\u2019s of goal setting. These 5 R\u2019s describe 5 different goal characteristics you should keep in mind when setting goals, each beginning with the letter R: - Relevant \u2014 your goal should be meaningful to you (or your company if you\u2019re setting company goals). In other words, it should align with your values and aspirations. - Realistic \u2014 your goal should be attainable in the sense that you have a reasonable amount of time, money, and skills to reach it. - Results-oriented \u2014 when setting your goals, you should focus on achieving specific outcomes or results rather than the process or actions you\u2019ve taken to achieve those results. - Reviewed \u2014 you should review your goals regularly (depending on the goal, you can do it weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually, for instance). This allows you to keep track of your progress but also adjust your goals if needed. - Responsible \u2014 you should consider your goal solely your responsibility. In other words, if you fail to achieve your goal, you shouldn\u2019t blame others for it. Instead, you should stay accountable because that\u2019s the only way to unleash your full potential and successfully reach your goals. What are the 5 steps of goal setting? If you need some guidance on goal setting, the following 5 steps are essential for setting your goals effectively: - Decide what your goals are \u2014 in order to achieve something, you must first understand what you want to achieve and why you want to achieve it.

This will help you get a clear starting point and focus on what\u2019s most important to you. - Write down your goals \u2014 if your goals stay only in your mind, you may drift away from them or even forget about your goals altogether. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to write them down so you can remind yourself of your goals every time you look at them. - Make an action plan \u2014 to be able to reach your goals, you need to know what actions you need to take to achieve them. If you\u2019re not sure where to start, the best practice is to break your larger goals down into smaller tasks. This will also make your goals feel more attainable. - Create a timeline \u2014 having a timeline that clearly outlines your tasks and the deadlines you must meet for those tasks is critical to achieving your goals. It helps you see how much time you have to complete each task towards your larger goal, which creates a sense of urgency and keeps you accountable. - Track your progress \u2014 keeping track of your progress toward your goals allows you to see how close you are to achieving them. It also lets you identify if there\u2019s anything you need to improve in your goal-setting process to reach your goals faster. Tips for setting and reaching goals To easily set and achieve your goals, here are some tips that you may find useful: - Set SMART goals \u2014 as we mentioned in one of the subheadings above, setting goals that are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound is essential to creating effective goals. This process allows you to set clear and realistic goals that also have a deadline \u2014 which will help you stay focused on your way to success. - Take your passions into consideration \u2014 if you want to feel motivated while working on your goals, make sure they include something you\u2019re passionate about. This will also allow you to feel a certain sense of pride once you achieve your goals. - Prioritize your goals \u2014 while you may have a lot of goals that you want to achieve, it\u2019s almost impossible to work on them all at once. That\u2019s why it\u2019s best to focus on a few goals that are most important to you and set them first. - Be prepared for setbacks \u2014 even though you may falter on the way to achieving your goals, that doesn\u2019t mean you should give up on them.
