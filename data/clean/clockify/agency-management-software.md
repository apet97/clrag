Detailed reports are perfect for a growing agency
At the end of every project, we make a Clockify report, and we look at what went over budget on what part of the production, and how we can change that for the future. We have critical thinking at the end of each project on how to accomplish it more seamlessly the next time. Clients can actually see the time logged, the number of meetings, requested revisions, workshopping, and everything in between with detailed notes and the time spent on it. The client is typically impressed and loves that we keep track of that information. It keeps everyone accountable and there’s no guesswork.
