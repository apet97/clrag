Key concepts
#
Get familiar with key concepts and processes you might come across when working with upgrades and subscriptions on Clockify.
Billing & seats
#
Please be aware that you will be charged each billing cycle for the
total number
of user seats you have. So, if you have more user seats than the active users in the workspace, you will be charged for
all user seats
whether they are used or not.
You only need to buy a seat for an active user in your workspace. If a user is deactivated, manually remove their seat from the
Subscription
page. Activated users count as used seats and total number of seats represent the number of seats available in that workspace.
For example:
You paid an annual subscription for two user seats. You had two active users for a couple of months and then deactivated one. Now, you have one vacant user seat and you can invite new user that will take up that seat. This means that each time you
deactivate
a user, you free up a seat they used to occupy.
User seats
#
Represent the number of active team members you can have in your workspace. When you subscribe to a paid plan for the first time, you must buy a seat for each active user, but you can also buy more seats if you plan on inviting more users in the future.
Bundle seats
#
Represent a number of active members on Clockify, Pumble and Plaky workspaces purchased with
Bundle subscription plan
within
CAKE.com
Productivity Suite.
For detailed instructions on how manage Bundle seats, check out
Bundle seats
article.
Team member
#
Team member is every
active user
that joins or is invited in the workspace regardless of their user role and features they use. Every time a new user joins or is invited to your workspace, they take up one user seat. If there are no available user seats left, you won’t be able to invite users and they won’t be able to join your workspace.
Full & limited users
#
While using
kiosk
, you’ll come across two types of users:
Full
and
Limited
. Full users refer to team members when the Kiosk feature is enabled, while Limited users are those that have restricted access and can only clock in/out as required.
If you’d like to
add
Limited users to your workspace, you’ll be charged for that separately.
Manage user seats
#
If you’ve used all available user seats in your workspace, you can add more users by purchasing additional seats on the
Subscription
page in the app.
Only workspace owners/admins can manage subscriptions and add/remove user seats.
Clockify Subscription page
#
The
Subscription
page allows you to manage user seats, have an overview of all your invoices and subscription plans with the option to upgrade/downgrade to the subscription plan that suits your needs.

Subscription

Subscription
page, you’ll see three tabs:
Billing
Invoices

Billing
tab tracks your current subscription plan, price, used and available user seats and all the features at your disposal available with your subscription plan. It also includes all your
customer

Invoices
tab in a new window, where you can review and pay the invoice.
Subscription billing intervals
#
You can submit your payments periodically:
Annually
Monthly

Switch billing intervals
#
In the
Subscription
page, you can switch between two billing periods (monthly/annual) at any time.
Annual to monthly
: You’ll switch to monthly subscription plan after your current annual subscription ends
Monthly to annual
: You’ll be immediately charged a prorated price (annual price minus the remaining calculation from your current plan)
If you switch from your phone or tablet and you don’t see the link in the
Subscription
page, go to the
Upgrade
page and you’ll see the annual billing link next to monthly.
Please note when buying seats that all the prices are
prorate
.

Upgrade
#

Subscription
page in the following way:

Open the menu
Choose
Subscription
from the dropdown

Plans
tab
Click

below the plan you’d like to downgrade to
Confirm the action
Warning banner provides details regarding the downgrade to the plan below. If you choose to downgrade, once your current subscription ends, the new subscription to the lower plan starts. The same logic is applied if you’re switching from the annual to the monthly plan.
