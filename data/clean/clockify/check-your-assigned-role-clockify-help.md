Check your assigned role
2 min read
In Clockify, user roles define the level of access and permissions you have within the workspace. Knowing your role provides a better insight into what you can and cannot do in Clockify.
Whether you’re an Admin, Manager, or Regular user, here’s how you can easily check your user role:
Open your browser and navigate to Clockify
Log in with your credentials
Once logged in, go to the
Team
page from the sidebar
You’ll find a list of all workspace members, including those with Full, Limited, and Group access
Here, you can see the role assigned to you within the workspace (e.g. Admin, Team Manager, Project Manager or User)

#
Admin
: Full access to manage all aspects of the workspace, including user management, permissions, and billing
Manager
: Can manage teams, track time, and view reports, but cannot change workspace settings or billing
User
: Can track time and view reports but does not have permissions to manage teams or settings
If you don’t see the
Team
page in your sidebar, you may not have permission to view it. In that case, contact your workspace owner/admin or the person who invited you to the workspace.
You can check who that is in the workspace invitation email:
