Groups make
managing people on projects
easier. Instead of adding people to project one by one, you can create a group and assign it to a
project
in one click.
You can create, edit, and delete groups in the
Groups
tab of a
Team
page.

Assign groups to projects
#
Groups make managing people on projects easy. When people change teams or leave the company often, you don’t have to go through each project and remove them – all you have to do is remove them from the group.
You can add users to groups on the
Team
page, and then
allocate the group
to a project.
To assign a group to a project:
Go to a project
Click
Access
tab
Click
+ Add
members
Select the group
Once you assign a group, everyone that belongs to that group will immediately have access to the project.
You can
filter reports
by a group. For example, you can make a Developers group, and use the group as a filter to see only what your developers work on (and later,
group the report
by User to see the time breakdown for each developer). You can also simply group the Summary report by Group and see a breakdown for each group.
