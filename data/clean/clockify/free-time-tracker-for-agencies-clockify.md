Manage projects and progress with software for creative agencies
Create tasks and assign people to them so they can track time against them. Estimate how long each task should take and use graphs/pies to check the progress visually. If a project goes over budget, Clockify can send you an alert.
Track project profitability
Reports break down all the tracked time and group it by project and client. Clockify's Detailed reports page lets you see how much of the tracked time is billable and how much you've earned that week or month based on your hourly rates. You can also export data or share a link with your client.

How time tracking for agencies work
Step 1
Create an account
Sign up for free
Step 2
Set up projects
Create projects, categorize them by clients, and create tasks. Then, all your employees have to do is choose a project/task (and provide a brief optional description of what they're doing) and start the timer.
Step 3
Invite your team
You can have an unlimited number of users for free (developers, designers, managers, clients).
Step 4
Track time
Your team can track time using a timer or enter their time manually. They can track time in the browser, or via
desktop and mobile apps
. Desktop apps come with useful features like reminders, idle detection, and more.
Step 5
Track time inside other apps
Install
Chrome
,
Firefox
, and
Edge extensions
and a timer button will appear in your
favorite web apps
so you can track time more easily (Trello, Asana, Todoist, etc.).
Step 6
Set hourly rates
Set hourly rates for each employee and project. All your team has to do is track time and make sure time entries are marked as billable — Clockify will automatically calculate the billable amounts in reports and do the heavy-lifting itself.
Step 7
Track progress on projects
Set estimates for tasks and projects, and later compare estimated vs tracked time and get notifications when a project goes over budget.
Step 8
Export reports
You can run an online report and break down time tracking data however you need. When the time comes, export the report as PDF, Excel, or CSV, or share a link to the report with your client.
