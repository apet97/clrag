What is Clockify? (11:05)
Work time tracker — Clockify
Clockify is a time tracking tool that helps you categorize and track your progress during a work day.
You'll know exactly how much time you've spent on a certain task, how many seconds you've been unproductive, and you'll get a complete report that can help you improve in the future.
Also, basic Clockify features are absolutely free!
Employee tracking app — features
Clockify offers many basic and
advanced features
that can revolutionize the way you handle your everyday tasks — here are some of them.
Timer
Clockify's operational premise is simple — input your current activity, select the type of project you're working on, and start the timer. The app will keep track of your progress in the background, even if you've closed the tab.
Then, stop the timer when you're finished with the current activity and start a new one. You can always come back to previous activities and restart the timers if you have more work to do.
Timesheet
Clockify grants you access to a
neatly organized timesheet
from where you can log in your weekly hours. You can also create templates for specific tasks and time entries, so you don't have to type in the same thing each time.
Review and edit personal entries
This employee hour tracker software lets you manually edit each time entry. You can:
Rename your tasks
Switch between projects
Input different start/end times
Mark entries as
billable/non-billable
Personal time dashboard
Every employee in Clockify's workspace can analyze their hours and see where they can improve. You'll have access to a work time tracker that measures individual and group activity throughout the week and how many hours each member logged in.
Track time from anywhere
Start tracking time in your browser, stop the timer on your phone - all your time entries are synced between the phone apps, desktop apps, and the website.
Available for web, desktop, and mobile
Time tracking is more convenient using a dedicated app
Idle time detection (Mac)
Clockify can detect when you're away from computer and lets you decide what to do with that inactive time
