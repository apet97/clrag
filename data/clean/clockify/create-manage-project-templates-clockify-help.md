Create & manage project templates
2 min read
If you continuously work on similar projects, it’s a good idea to set up a project template so you don’t have to bother creating the same project over and over. Projects you create with an existing template will have settings such as Billable Rates, Estimates, Tasks, Team, and
Custom Fields
already applied.
Project template is a paid feature, which you can enable by
upgrading
your workspace to any of the paid plans.

Here’s how you can set up a project as template:
Go to your
Projects
page
Click on the
three dots
near the project’s name
Select
Set as template
You can set up an unlimited number of templates.
If a user on a project set as template doesn’t have an account yet, they won’t have access to projects made from the template.

Now that you’ve set up a project template, you can use it when creating new projects.
Go to your
Projects
page
Click the
Create new project
button in the upper-right corner
Click the
No template
field
Choose your template from the drop-down
Click
Create
Remove template
#
If you no longer want a certain project to serve as a template, you can easily remove it as a template.
Go to your
Projects
page
Click on the
three dots
near the project’s name
Select
Don’t use as template
If you archive a certain project that serves as a template, that’s okay, it will still be offered as a template until you manually remove it as a template.
Regular users can’t create new templates or delete existing ones. Also, only regular users assigned to the private project saved as template can use this template.
Change template
#
If you change a project that was saved as a template, projects created based on that template will not be changed.
Only new projects created from the changed template will reflect the changes.
