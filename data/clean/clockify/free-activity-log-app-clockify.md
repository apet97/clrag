When you begin working, use the timer to start logging time with the work log app or use the shortcut — it'll run automatically in the background.

Manually log activity
If you don't use the timer (or forgot to start it), you can manually enter what you've worked on.
Step 5
Categorize time
You can categorize time by project and tag so you can analyze where you spend time — compare your time entries, see what tasks take up the most time, and find ways to improve your productivity with the activity tracking app.
Step 6
Analyze activities
Open the
Dashboard
to see your most tracked activities and where you spend the most time.
Step 7
See on-field user activity

Step 8
See and export daily work log
Detailed report lets you see all your activity in chronological order, which you can export as PDF, Excel or CSV.
If you want to see daily user arrival and departure times, total tracked work hours, overtime, and breaks, just switch to the
Attendance report
and analyze user activity.
