What makes a good scheduling software?
The key thing a scheduling software should provide is a simple scheduling system that will
make your daily work run smoothly
.
Besides its functionality and the extensive list of scheduling features, there are certain aspects that should be acknowledged when choosing a scheduling software.
1. Price
One of the first things that can make or break a call to try out a certain software is the price. An unusually high price can instantly put off potential customers, especially while they’re not still sure about the value they’re getting.
Ideally, a scheduling software should offer a free trial, to give potential users first-hand experience of the benefits they are getting, and how intuitive the software is for them.
Get a budget-friendly app
2. Availability on devices
Introducing new software to a company is the easiest when you don’t have to make a huge shift in resources that you use. Ideally, new software should be available for the devices and operating systems that you currently use.
3. Reviews
Checking customer reviews on the software that you’re interested in helps you get to know the overall user impression of the software, what works great, and what is the biggest issue with using the software, or simply interacting with the company.
4. Customer service
Apart from understanding the issues users ran into while using the software, reviews also provide insights on the experience users had with a company’s support team - how soon they were contacted, how knowledgeable and kind was the support team, and whether the problem occurred again or was resolved after first try.
How do we decide on the best scheduling software?
The criteria that mentioned above are common ways of evaluating the expected quality of the software. But, each user will probably have personal preferences that are not in direct correlation with these criteria.
Thus, the best scheduling software should be flexible enough to accommodate the needs of the largest number of users. In line with that, the best scheduling software should:
Provide some value for everyone
- Software with a large list of features covers a large variety of needs. Its value increases as more features make it applicable to a wider range of professional settings.
Have features that are unique to it
- As much as a large list of features can be an advantage, advanced and unique features affirm its position on the market and create a unique niche of users.
Be affordable
- A competitive scheduling software offers various pricing plans for segmented users. Ideally, it can also offer a free version with real value for its user, or a free trial option to test it out.
Have a large pool of satisfied users
- Nothing speaks about the quality of software better than a large pool of happy users and positive reviews. A satisfied user that took the time to leave feedback provides valuable insights on software’s usefulness, the experience of using it, and the changes it made to their (work) life after implementing it.
Overview of the best scheduling software for 2022
Based on the outlined criteria, we have pointed out the 7 best scheduling software that currently stand out on the market.
A more detailed analysis presented below will provide a deeper overview of the main functionalities and benefits each scheduling software offers to a potential user.
