Invite users & assign roles in your workspace
6 min read
Workspace Admins and Owners are responsible for managing users within their workspace. This includes inviting team members, assigning roles, and managing user profiles. With these capabilities, you can ensure your team has the proper access to track and manage time efficiently.
In this guide, we’ll walk you through the process of inviting users, assigning roles, and managing user settings to ensure your workspace is set up for success.
Invite users to your workspace
#
To get started, you’ll need to invite team members to your workspace, so they can track time. As an
Admin
or
Owner
, you’re the only ones who can invite users to the workspace.
Steps to invite users:
Go to the
Team
page
Depending on the type of member you’d like to add, go to
Full
or
Limited
tab
Click
Add full/limited member
Enter the email addresses of the users you want to invite. You can invite multiple users at once by separating the emails with commas or by entering them one by one.
Free plan
: You can invite up to 5 users at once
Paid plan
: You can invite an unlimited number of users
Send invitation:
Click
Send invite
to send the invitations
Once the user accepts the invitation, they become a member of the workspace.
Invite users manually
#
If you’ve added users but they haven’t received an email invitation, you can manually resend the invitation:
Go to the
Team
page
Click the
three dots
next to the user’s name
Select
Send an invite email
Members can
sign up
on their own and they’ll automatically be part of your workspace (if they have a pending invite).
Accept the invite
#
Once invited, users will receive an email with an activation link.
To accept the invite:
Click the activation link in the email
Verify email
: They’ll be asked to verify their email address
Start tracking time

If a member already has a Clockify account, they have to
log in
and accept the invite via the bell notification in the upper right corner.

Team
