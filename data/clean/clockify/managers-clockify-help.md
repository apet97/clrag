In Clockify, there are two types of managers:
Project
managers and
Team
managers.
Please note that CAKE.com permissions also apply, as CAKE.com operates as the central organization. For more details on CAKE.com permissions and how they affect individual products, please refer to

Set estimates
Add tasks

Approve submitted timesheets for members assigned to their projects (if enabled)

Team manager

Team managers

Team manager role is an additional feature available through upgrading your workspace to a Standard, Pro, or Enterprise plan.
Customizing visibility of certain app features, like hiding pages, also applies to managers. Managers have access to Reports, and project managers additionally have access to the Projects page.
