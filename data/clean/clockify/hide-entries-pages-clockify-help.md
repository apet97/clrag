By default, all members of your workspace can see all time entries and expenses. However, you can hide this information, if necessary.
Hide tracked time and expenses
#
Hiding tracked time and expenses from other users in your workspace is a paid feature, which you can enable by
upgrading
your workspace to any of our paid plans.
To hide tracked time and expenses:
Open
Workspace settings
Choose
Permissions
tab
Find
Regular users can see
section
Check the option that fits your preferences
You can choose if regular users can see:
All tracked time
and expenses
: regular users will be able to see the time entries and expenses made by other people on every project
Only time and expenses on public projects
: regular users will be able to see the time entries and expenses made by other people on public projects
Only their own time
and expenses
: regular users will only be able to see their own entries
and expenses
You can also choose whether users can
access Team Dashboard
and if they can
access project status tab
(so they can track progress and how much of the estimate remains). If users can access status but can’t see billable rates, they’ll only be able to see progress and all amounts will remain hidden.
This setting doesn’t affect project managers. Project managers, even though they’re regular users, can see all tracked time on projects where they have the manager role.

Additionally, you can hide Projects, Team, and reports pages from Regular users’ side bar.
Hiding pages affects managers differently:
Project managers always see Reports and Projects pages
Team managers always see Reports page
