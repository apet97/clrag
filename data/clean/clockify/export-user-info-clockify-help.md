Export user info
2 min read
If you’re managing a lot of users and would like to have a single file that summarizes all their data (name, email address, billable rate, role…), you can do that by using the
Export
user info feature on
Teams
page.
By exporting info to a CSV/Excel file, you can easily analyze it and even integrate it with some other tools like accounting software, project management tools or some CRM (customer relationship management) systems.
User info export is available on all subscription plans, but can only be performed by Admins.
To export user info:
Navigate to
Team
page
Depending on the info you’d like to export, choose:
Full
tab (info about
full members
*)
Limited
tab (info about
limited members
*)
Groups
tab (info about
user groups
)
Continue and:
Expand the
Export
dropdown menu at the top right corner of the page
Choose the format:
CSV
/
Excel
User info will be exported to your device.
The type of info that is exported depends on the selected filters. If not filtered out otherwise, all active and inactive users are downloaded by default. Also, since invited users do not have a name set until they join the workspace, the
Name
column is empty.
*Full/Limited tabs are visible only if Kiosk is enabled in the Workspace settings. Also, you’ll have the PIN column with users’ PIN codes when downloading the file.
If the Kiosk feature is not enabled, then the
Team
page will look like this:
You can export:
Members
(info about
full members
)
Groups
(info about
user groups
)
Clockify also offers you to customize the info prior to the export. The
Customize
option is available only on paid plans (Basic or higher), or on a
Free trial
.
