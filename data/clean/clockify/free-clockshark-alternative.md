Why replace ClockShark with Clockify
Free-forever plan
Get started for FREE, with unlimited number of users. Upgrade at any time if you need additional features.
Time tracking
Let your employees clock in and out from a kiosk station, mobile app, desktop or web. Time entries can be made automatically or manually, and the data is synchronized across devices.
Clockify can track the GPS location of your on-field workers while they’re on the go, providing you with the data to better manage your employees' schedules.
Easy scheduling
Create shifts based on employee availability, assign multiple people to projects or tasks, and make adjustments with dragging and dropping.
Custom-made reports
Choose which data you want to include and export it as a report in PDF, Excel, or CSV file for a customized period. Reports can also be shared with others and scheduled to be received automatically each day, week, or month.
Assign roles and communicate with your team
In Clockify you assign different roles and permissions to employees, upload company policies, approve time-off requests, and manage vacation days for your team.
Clockify offers you a free communication and collaboration tool - Pumble - to share messages and files, or make calls. All exchanged messages stay saved and accessible forever.
24/7 support
If you're working late hours - we do too. With 24/7 customer support, you can reach out for support on whatever interrupts your flow.
