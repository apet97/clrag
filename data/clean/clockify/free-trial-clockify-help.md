Trial can be activated only once per workspace. Also, if the workspace was upgraded at any point, trial won’t appear.
Add sample data
#
When you activate Free trial, simply check the option to add sample data to your workspace.
With sample data, you get a pre-filled workspace with sample projects, clients, time entries and all other Clockify data.
This allows you to explore Clockify features and see how they work before you start using your own data.
This feature is available to all users on Free trial.
Only Owner or Admin can add sample data.
Once added, every member of your workspace can view and edit the data based on their permissions.
Keep in mind that you can’t send invoices while on Free trial.
Remove sample data

You can also easily remove sample data at any time to start fresh.
Click the bell in the upper right corner to open your notifications
Click on
Remove sample data
Confirm the action
Sample data in the workspace is automatically removed as soon as the Free trial ends.
You can add sample data again, from your notifications, as long as your Free trial is active.
When trial ends
#
When trial is active, you’ll have a countdown timer in the upper left corner in Clockify, showing you how many days you have left.
When trial ends:
You’ll be downgraded to the FREE version
All paid features will be disabled (e.g. custom fields, expenses, time off)
Data you created and imported will remain
After you
upgrade
your account, you’ll be able to resume the access to the paid features and the data you’ve used.
If you need more time to test paid features,
contact us
for the trial extension and we’d be glad to help.
If you need more time to test things, you can contact us for trial extension or a live
