Clockify notifications in Pumble app
4 min read
Receive important notifications from Clockify directly in
Pumble
, our integrated business messaging platform. This helps your team stay informed and quickly take actions without leaving your communication tool.
How it works
#
Clockify sends key notifications (like time tracking reminders, time off and approval updates) directly to your Pumble app workspace. This way, you can stay up-to-date with your team’s activities without having to check your email.
Get notifications
#
If you have at least one active Clockify and one active Pumble workspace
in the same CAKE.com organization
, you’ll automatically start receiving notifications from Clockify in Pumble.
Go to
Profile settings
in Clockify
Open the menu
Navigate to
Preferences
and choose
Pumble notifications
tab
Click
Try Pumble
If you
don’t have
a Pumble workspace, follow a
guide
and create one
If you already have a Pumble account (using the same email as in Clockify), you’ll be prompted to connect an existing Pumble app workspace or create a new one
One Pumble workspace can be connected to multiple Clockify workspaces. However, if you have multiple Pumble workspaces in your organization, you need to choose which one will be connected to Clockify.
Once connected:
You’ll be notified in both Clockify and Pumble that the integration is live, with the link to manage your notification settings
You’ll receive Clockify notifications in Pumble based on your preferences
