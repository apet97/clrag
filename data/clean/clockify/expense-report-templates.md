What is an Expense Report?
An expense report is a form that lets you track all business-related costs — from employee-incurred expenses to project-specific costs.
This record usually serves as a basis for a cash reimbursement request for the amounts employees spend while on a particular business duty.
However, expense reports can also be used to:
- Record project costs,
- Evaluate total expenses, and
- Come up with better budget estimates.
Notable examples of items that should be included in an expense report include:
- Money spent on gas during business travels or for running everyday business errands,
- Money spent on means of transportation during business travels,
- Money spent on business lunches and dinners with clients, or
- Money spent on lodgings during business travels.
How does an expense report work?
Here's how expense reporting works in more detail:
- Each time employees on business duty pay in cash, they use an expense report to itemize their expenditures.
- Employees attach the expense-related receipts to the expense report, to serve as proof that the amounts listed in the report match the actual amounts spent.
- Finally, employees submit the completed report to their employer or company bookkeeper, who writes them a check to reimburse the listed expenses.
What should be included in an expense report?
An expense report usually consists of:
- Employee information,
- The date the expense was incurred,
- The type or category of the expense,
- A subtotal for each expense,
- The total expense amount, and
- Additional information.

What does your expense report say about you?
Not only do expense reports underline some of the issues people might have with them, but they also say a lot about the employees who fill them out.
The research included in the Wall Street Journal helps distinguish among five different types of employees based on how they approach the expense reporting process:
- Expense Report ‘’Sidestepper’’,
- Expense Report ‘’Martyr’’,
- Expense Report ‘’Payback Artist’’,
- Expense Report ‘’Rookie’’, and
- Expense Report ‘’Grifter’’.
So what type are you?
Are you an expense report "Sidestepper"?
The Sidestepper is often reluctant to report their expenses to the employer, no matter how big or small.
Let's call the Sidestepper Alice.
Alice finds the data she needs to add to her expense report confusing.
She believes the process takes too much of her time.
She also fears that her employer will start questioning the items in her Report if some of the items turn out pricer than expected.
So, Alice the Sidestepper often decides that it's easier not to report the expenses and often pays for them from her own pocket.
What to do if you're an expense report "Sidestepper"?
Take your time to understand your company’s expense policy — ask for further clarification from the company's bookkeeper or your colleagues when needed.
Treat your expense report like a work task, and define the time you'll spend on it on a daily or weekly basis.
Then, track the time you spend filling out each Report to make sure you stay within your predefined time limit.
Where applicable, use the reports note and description sections to clarify why certain items turned out costlier than expected.
Are you an expense report "Martyr"?
The Martyr often avoids filing for expense reimbursement. But, unlike the Sidestepper, who avoids the process because they are too "confusing" or "stress-inducing," the Martyr does so because they feel personally "close" to the company and its cause. Therefore, Martyrs treat these business expenses like their own.
Let's call the Martyr Peter.
Peter the Martyr rarely asks for reimbursements and covers most of his job-related expenses from his own pocket.
What to do if you're an expense report "Martyr"?
The feeling of closeness you have to your company is admirable, but you should still file reimbursement requests for your business-related expenses. Asking for reimbursement is necessary if you want to stay compliant with your company's expense policy.
Are you an expense report "Payback Artist"?
Unlike the Sidestepper and the Martyr, the Payback Artist is overzealous in asking for expense reimbursement.
Let's call the Payback Artist Matt.
Matt asks for reimbursement for every dollar he spends — because he wants to pay the company back for something he believes is an injustice toward him.
This "payback" may be tied to his salary being smaller than he thinks he deserves.
Or, it may be tied to Matt thinking his superiors have salaries much bigger than he thinks they deserve.
It may also be tied to some rejected expense reimbursement he experienced in the past — and now he wants to settle that expense indirectly, through other requests.
So, Matt, the Payback Artist, decides to file for as many expense reimbursements as he believes are enough before he and the company are square.
What to do if you're an expense report "Payback Artist"?
If you unjustly didn't get approval for a past reimbursement request, don't turn to payback. Sure, it might make you feel better, but it does nothing to stop the problem from happening in the future. Instead, turn the matter over to a higher entity in your company.
If you think your salary is unfair, don't up your expense report to make matters even — try asking for a salary raise, coupled with concrete proof of why you deserve one. You might be pleasantly surprised by the outcome of it.
Are you an expense report "Rookie"?
The Rookie is also overzealous in making sure the expenses listed are in order — because they generally don't know precisely when and how to ask for a reimbursement.
Let's call the Rookie Christina.
Christina just got her first job at a prestigious company, and she's still unfamiliar with how the expense policy of her new company works.
It's hard for her to decide what to file a reimbursement claim for. When she travels for business, she books cheap flights and stays in economical hotels because she believes that's the right thing to do.
Let's now look at another Rookie — David.
David also just got a job at a prestigious company. However, unlike Christina, David always asks for the most expensive services when on a business trip, because he believes that's what the concept of expense reimbursement is for.
So, Christina and David are both Rookies, but in different ways — she is afraid of overstepping an imaginary boundary, and he treats the reimbursement policy like an invitation to spend money freely.
What to do if you're an expense report "Rookie"?
Study your company's expense policy, and underline the points you don't understand. You can then ask the company's bookkeeper to clarify these points — or you can ask your colleagues about the general amounts they spend on the items you tend to overspend or underspend on.
Are you an expense report "Grifter"?
The Grifter generally plays loose with the "business" part of the phrase "business expense policy" — and tends to also ask for reimbursement for more personal expenses.
Let's call the Grifter Annabelle.
Annabelle likes to expand the expense policy beyond typical business expenses — to items that range from babysitting services to new jewelry.
But, she is a high-achiever at her company, so the employer generally turns a blind eye to such behavior.
So, Anabelle the Grifter is similar to the Rookies David and Christina — the difference is that she knows her expense policy well, yet she often decides to bypass it.
What to do if you're an expense report "Grifter"?
You might want to be more careful about adding questionable items to your expense reports — just because you got away with it three times, it doesn't mean you won't get into trouble the 4th time. So, try to keep your expense reimbursement requests within a reasonable amount and purpose.
Simplify your expense processing with an Expense tracker
Although expense report templates are a nifty way to keep an eye on your expenses, as is the case with all ready-made templates, they might not always be a one-size-fits-all solution.
Sometimes you might need to include more detail than you can fit in a premade template, so you’ll find it easier to go for another option that can keep all your costs in one place, and this is where an expense tracker can turn out to be useful.
But, what is an expense tracker?
Well, its purpose is to help speed up the process of expense reporting even further.
This type of software helps you calculate and keep the costs of your business operations and tasks in one place. You can quickly generate reports from here showing how much you need to be reimbursed for a business-related activity, be it business travel, a client lunch, or a promotional event.
Despite it not being a traditional expense report software, you can use Clockify to help facilitate the process of expense reporting even further — alongside the listed Expense Report Templates.
How can Clockify help you speed up expense reporting?
In its essence, Clockify is free time tracking software that lets you easily track the time you spend on tasks and projects before automatically calculating how much you need to be paid for your time. But, it can also help you speed up your expense reporting — if you use Clockify's custom fields.
The custom fields feature lets you add a special custom field to your time entries (either for all projects or only for some projects) where you'll be able to:
- Add your expenses for each task you track time on,
- Specify your mileage on business trips,
- Add links to your receipts, and more.
Later on, you'll be able to export a Detailed Report of your time results and view your time entries, as well as their specific expenses, mileage, and receipts listed in a CSV or Excel table.
Other uses for Clockify in your expense reporting
In addition to helping you record your expenses, Clockify can also help you record and see whether the time you spend on the said business tasks is really worth it.
This knowledge will really help put the time you spend on certain business tasks in perspective. Perhaps you'll find that the 10 business lunches with clients you arrange per month are literally not worth your time.
Here's how you can draw these conclusions with Clockify:
- Define the projects you're working on,
- Define your project-related tasks, and
- Define a specific hourly rate for each of your projects.
When you want to take a client out for a business lunch, treat it like a task you'll add to the appropriate project in your project list at Clockify.
You can track time on this project-related task by starting a timer and tracking time while you're at the business lunch.
Or, you can add the time you've spent on the said task manually after you've parted ways with your client.
Either way, you'll get your earnings for the time you invested in this business task calculated automatically.
Perhaps you'll find that you've just spent $90 on a 3-hour business lunch with a client who decided to cut down significantly on the billable time your company is expected to put in for the project in the future.
In contrast, if your hourly rate for this project is $50, you've not only overspent for lunch, but you've also just lost 3 hours you could have allocated to more actionable tasks ($90 spent, in contrast with the $150 you could have earned by working on something else).
