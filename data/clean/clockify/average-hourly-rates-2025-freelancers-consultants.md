Get familiar with the average hourly rates for your profession
— it’s important to be aware of the pricing on the market to set a reasonable price,
Communicate confidently
— after you’ve done your research and set your freelance hourly rate, make sure to communicate the rate with confidence and without hesitation,
Ask for a 20-30% higher hourly rate
— in this way, if the potential employer wants to decrease it, you’ll reach the realistic rate together, and
