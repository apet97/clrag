We got tired of paying thousands of dollars for Toggl
We used to spend $2,000 each month on a time tracker just so everyone could log their time. That was too much. So, we created Clockify. It has everything teams and companies really need, without costing a fortune
Nenad Milanovic, CEO at Clockify
Clockify is awesome.
It's truly a wonderful, free alternative to other platforms like Toggl
, which I have been using for years. Clockify has great features and functions that allow our team to have a wonderful workflow.
— Nyk Zukowski
Thanks a ton, you have a great product and an interesting pricing model. As a company we'd be happy to pay a more than just 10 bucks a month for what it's worth (something like the
Toggl pricing is unbearable for us as a startup
).
— Lasse Schuirmann, CEO Viperdev.io
I would like to say that
I am extremely happy with Clockify! I switched from Toggl and I have to say that I am glad to have been introduced to Clockify.
It is perfect for me and my team! Congratulations for your product! This tool is a game changer in our company.
— Renato Gomes, Software Architect
I really like your software and I was happy when I was trying it for a while. I hope my boss will see it in the same way.
Still cannot believe you have your cloud version basically free, while toggl charges so much.
— Marek Kajfosz, Echopix
I love Clockify!
I have and will continue to recommend you to my friends and colleagues in lieu of Toggl.
Your free vs paid features make much more sense than theirs! Please don't ever change that like Toggl did some time back, putting some of their core functionality behind a paywall!
— Joe Ammel, Owner at YourContentEditor
As a user of Toggl, this is a really great find!
— Darryl Wright
Fantastic system,
everything we actually needed from Toggl, but free!
