How to track time in ClickUp
Start timer inside ClickUp
Clockify timer button will automatically appear in all ClickUp tasks.
Timer starts ticking
Clockify will pick up ClickUp's task name and the timer will start ticking. You can stop the timer from anywhere (browser, mobile, or desktop).
Sync projects
If there's a project in Clockify that matches the ClickUp folder, the extension will automatically select the project when you start tracking time so you don't have to do it manually.
Extension can also create projects, tasks, and tags in Clockify based on information in ClickUp. You can enable this in the extension's Settings.
Run time reports and manage projects
In the web version, you can edit past entries, analyze time, manage projects, invite people, review timesheets, and export reports.
