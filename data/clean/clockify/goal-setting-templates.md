What is a goal?
A goal is a desired outcome that a person commits to in order to achieve it.
There are many types of goals that you may want to achieve — from career goals and business goals (which are more oriented towards your professional life) to health goals and relationship goals (which are related to your personal life).
Moreover, goals can also be:
- Short-term, and
- Long-term, depending on the time span they refer to.
Short-term goals refer to the near future and may include something you want to achieve today, this week, this month, or even this year.
On the other hand, long-term goals refer to a more distant future and require more planning than short-term goals. They typically take 3-5 years to achieve, or longer.
What is goal setting and how can it help you?
Goal setting is the process of taking active steps in order to achieve your goals, that is, your desired outcomes. It includes the development of a plan you’ll need to follow to reach your goals.
Goal setting is important because it lays the foundation for everything you need to do to achieve your goals. It also helps you:
- Measure your progress towards your goals,
- Increase your motivation, and
- Direct your efforts towards what’s most important.
What are SMART goals?
SMART goals are objectives that are:
- Specific,
- Measurable,
- Attainable,
- Relevant, and
- Time-bound.
SMART goals are often used as a goal-setting framework because they cover all the essential aspects of a goal you should consider to reach your goals successfully.
How to set SMART goals (+ examples and templates)What are the 5 R’s of goal setting?
Besides using SMART goals, another way to set effective goals is to follow the 5 R’s of goal setting.
These 5 R’s describe 5 different goal characteristics you should keep in mind when setting goals, each beginning with the letter R:
- Relevant — your goal should be meaningful to you (or your company if you’re setting company goals). In other words, it should align with your values and aspirations.
- Realistic — your goal should be attainable in the sense that you have a reasonable amount of time, money, and skills to reach it.
- Results-oriented — when setting your goals, you should focus on achieving specific outcomes or results rather than the process or actions you’ve taken to achieve those results.
- Reviewed — you should review your goals regularly (depending on the goal, you can do it weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually, for instance). This allows you to keep track of your progress but also adjust your goals if needed.
- Responsible — you should consider your goal solely your responsibility. In other words, if you fail to achieve your goal, you shouldn’t blame others for it. Instead, you should stay accountable because that’s the only way to unleash your full potential and successfully reach your goals.
What are the 5 steps of goal setting?
If you need some guidance on goal setting, the following 5 steps are essential for setting your goals effectively:
- Decide what your goals are — in order to achieve something, you must first understand what you want to achieve and why you want to achieve it. This will help you get a clear starting point and focus on what’s most important to you.
- Write down your goals — if your goals stay only in your mind, you may drift away from them or even forget about your goals altogether. That’s why it’s important to write them down so you can remind yourself of your goals every time you look at them.
- Make an action plan — to be able to reach your goals, you need to know what actions you need to take to achieve them. If you’re not sure where to start, the best practice is to break your larger goals down into smaller tasks. This will also make your goals feel more attainable.
- Create a timeline — having a timeline that clearly outlines your tasks and the deadlines you must meet for those tasks is critical to achieving your goals. It helps you see how much time you have to complete each task towards your larger goal, which creates a sense of urgency and keeps you accountable.
- Track your progress — keeping track of your progress toward your goals allows you to see how close you are to achieving them. It also lets you identify if there’s anything you need to improve in your goal-setting process to reach your goals faster.
Tips for setting and reaching goals
To easily set and achieve your goals, here are some tips that you may find useful:
- Set SMART goals — as we mentioned in one of the subheadings above, setting goals that are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound is essential to creating effective goals. This process allows you to set clear and realistic goals that also have a deadline — which will help you stay focused on your way to success.
- Take your passions into consideration — if you want to feel motivated while working on your goals, make sure they include something you’re passionate about. This will also allow you to feel a certain sense of pride once you achieve your goals.
- Prioritize your goals — while you may have a lot of goals that you want to achieve, it’s almost impossible to work on them all at once. That’s why it’s best to focus on a few goals that are most important to you and set them first.
- Be prepared for setbacks — even though you may falter on the way to achieving your goals, that doesn’t mean you should give up on them. Instead, try to treat setbacks as learning opportunities and use them to see what you could do differently the next time you try to reach a particular goal.
- Celebrate your achievements — giving yourself a pat on the back after you achieve each goal motivates you to continue taking action towards reaching more difficult to attain future goals. It also increases your satisfaction and helps you build self-confidence.
