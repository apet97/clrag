To send an invoice email:
Go to the
Invoice
tab
Choose the invoice
Click the
Send invoice
button
Send invoice
screen opens with pre filled out info from the invoice
Optionally check the
Attach an expense report
,
Attach invoice as PDF
or
Send me copy
boxes
Click
Send
to conform the action
Checking either option sends all expenses included in the invoice to the client in PDF format.
As a result, the email is sent to your client based on the parameters defined in the Invoice settings.
To make sure your information stays safe, we added a PIN code access to your expense report. You’ll get this code in the invoice email. Just use it to open the report. The code expires seven days after the email is sent.
