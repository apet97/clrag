Why replace Calamari with Clockify
Free-forever plan
Get started for FREE, with an unlimited number of users. Upgrade at any time if you need additional features.
Clock in/out system
Let your employees clock in and out from a kiosk station, mobile app, desktop or web. Syncing across devices is always on. Time entries can be made automatically or manually, or edited if necessary.
Clockify allows you to set time tracking targets, receive overtime alerts, track GPS location of clocked-in employees, and automatically track the time you spend across apps, websites, and documents.
Team management
To manage your team, start by creating groups and assigning individual or multiple members to a project or a task, define who can do what, and give permissions.
You can see who is available to work, when and for how long, sync between Google or Outlook calendars, and schedule employees accordingly.
Absence management
Clockify allows you to upload company policies to help you communicate them with your team. You can request and approve time-off, vacation days, or sick leaves.
Clockify offers you a free communication and collaboration tool - Pumble - to share messages and files, or make calls. All exchanged messages stay saved and accessible forever.
As a free alternative to MS Teams and Slack, Pumble offers an unlimited message history and free file storage.
Custom reports
Set hourly rates per project, let your employees track their billable hours and export all the data when payroll comes around.
Select data to be included, and export customized weekly, summary, or detailed reports (PDF, Excel, CSV format).
