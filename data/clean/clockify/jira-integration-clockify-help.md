JIRA
Cloud
+ Clockify
Server
Since this plugin is not being installed via the JIRA marketplace, you will first have to
Enable development mode
in your cloud JIRA by going to
Manage Apps
/
Settings
. (After the installation is complete, this setting can be turned off).
After
Enable development mode
is turned on, you can install your custom JIRA plugin by selecting the
Upload URL
option, and providing a previously created public URL.
JIRA Data Center (JIRA Server) + Clockify Cloud/Server
Go to
Administration
>
Manage apps
Click
Upload app
Enter URL https://clockify-resources.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/downloads/clockify-jira-plugin.jar
Click
Upload
and install
If you’re using Clockify Server, you need to specify in the plugin’s Settings the URL to your Clockify Server account.
API Key
#
The first time you click on Clockify timer button, you will be asked for the Clockify API key. This key is used to connect your Clockify account to your JIRA account.
Log in to your Clockify account and go to the
Profile settings
>
Preferences
page >
Advanced
tab (or click on the
Get API key
link in your JIRA issue and you’ll be automatically redirected to your Clockify Profile settings).
At the bottom of this page click the
Generate
button to generate your API key
Copy your key to the API key field in your JIRA issue
Once you enter the key, you will not be asked for it again. However, if you, at some point, generate a new API key for your Clockify account, you will need to update it to match the one in JIRA as well, by resetting it.

Track time
#
When you click on the Clockify timer button you will be able to choose between the Timer and Manual mode you can use to track your time.
Timer mode
#
Make sure you’re in the Timer tab and then start the timer.  When you are done, click the
Stop
button and your time entry will be recorded.
If you have multiple workspaces in Clockify, you can select the desired workspace before starting the timer in JIRA.
The timer is synced to your Clockify account across all devices and can be stopped in JIRA or from any of the Clockify apps (browser, mobile, or desktop).
If you start tracking time in another JIRA issue without stopping the previous timer, the timer on the first issue will be automatically stopped and saved, and a new timer on the second issue will start.
Manual mode
#
If you forgot to start the timer, or you prefer to fill in all your work hours in one go, you can use manual mode.
Make sure you’re in the Manual tab and then enter the time you have worked on the time entry. When you are done, click the Add time button and your time entry will be recorded.
If you have multiple workspaces in Clockify, you can select the desired workspace before adding the time entry.
Please note that the current limitation for projects shown in the Project picker on Plug-in is 790.
What gets recorded in Clockify
#
When the timer starts, Clockify will automatically pick up the issue title, task, project, and label (tag) from JIRA if the corresponding project, task, etc. already exists in Clockify.
If there is no corresponding JIRA project, task, or tag in Clockify, the integration can automatically create it in Clockify. To make this possible, a user must have permission to create projects, tasks, and tags in Clockify. These permissions can be set in the Workspace settings.
Description –
Clockify will pick up the JIRA issue key number and issue title as a time entry description.
Project –
your project in JIRA will be picked up as a Project in Clockify.
Task –
the JIRA issue key where you started the timer will be picked up as a task (subproject) in Clockify. You can manually change the task you are working on directly from JIRA by clicking on the task name and selecting the one you want from the dropdown.
Tracking time on a Child issue in JIRA will be picked up as a task in Clockify with a tag
Subtask
.
Tags
– correspond to issue types (bug/task/story) and labels in JIRA. You can add more tags to your time entry directly from JIRA.
Information about an Epic or a Sprint will not be recorded, however, if you track time directly on an Epic in JIRA it will create a time entry in Clockify with a tag
Epic
.
In order for the integration to pick up the right project/task/tag, it either has to already exist in Clockify, or you need to set the right permissions in Clockify’s Workspace settings and make sure all users can create new projects/tasks/tags.
Work log
#
When you stop the timer, the entry will be saved in Clockify and a time log will be created in the JIRA work log (time spent field). Work log shows a timeline of each time entry recorded by everyone for that issue.
If you edit/delete a time log entry from JIRA work log, note that this will not be synced with Clockify, meaning that a time entry in Clockify will not be updated/deleted. Likewise, if you edit/delete a time entry in Clockify, it will not be reflected in JIRA.
Only time entries
stopped in JIRA issues
are going to be added to the work log.
