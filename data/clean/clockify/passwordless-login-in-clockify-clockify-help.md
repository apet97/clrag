is an authentication method that completely removes the need for passwords. Instead of entering a password, you need to authenticate yourself by using

Passwordless login
offers improved security compared to traditional password-based authentication and several more advantages:
Convenience
No need to remember or type a password. Just a single action (entering an OTP code) grants access
Increased security
Without passwords, you eliminate common password-related security risks:
Password reuse (using the same password across multiple sites)
Phishing attacks (tricking users into entering their password on a fake site)
Weak or stolen passwords
Lower risk of account compromise
As there are no passwords involved, there is no risk of a password being leaked, guessed, or stolen through brute-force attacks.
Many large corporations are adopting passwordless login because it’s safer and provides a better experience for users. It helps protect your account from common threats while making logging in easier and faster.
