Bulk edit time entries for your team
7 min read
One of the responsibilities of a Manager is to make sure that there is accurate and up-to-date time tracking for your team. If you manage a large volume of time entries, the
Bulk edit
feature will help you improve this process. Here’s how to make the most of this feature.
What is bulk edit?
#
Bulk edit
allows you to update multiple time entries at once. Whether you’re adjusting tags, changing project details, or marking time entries as favorites, Bulk edit can save you time and ensure consistency across your team’s time tracking.
Access permissions for bulk edit
#
As a
Team manager
or
Project manager
, you have permission to bulk edit and bulk delete time entries. However, please note that
Admins
have the highest level of access and can configure workspace settings like required fields and general permissions. You’ll have full control over your team’s time entries but may need to coordinate with an Admin for certain settings.
How to bulk edit time entries
#
You can bulk edit time entries directly from the
Time tracker
page:
Go to the
Time tracker
page where your team’s daily time entries are recorded
Find the
edit icon
next to the total number of hours tracked for a specific day
Click the edit icon, and
bulk edit
will be enabled for that day’s time entries
Once bulk edit is active, you can modify multiple time entries for that day at once.
Update multiple time entries in the Detailed report
#
To update time entries across a larger time range, follow these steps:
Go to the Detailed report
Use the checkboxes to select the time entries you want to edit
You can also use
filters
to narrow down which time entries you want to modify (e.g. by project, user, or date)
After selecting the entries, click the
Bulk edit
button at the top of the table
You’ll be able to modify several fields, including:
Tags
Projects
Tasks
Description
For each field you want to update, choose the new values.  For example:
Change the tags or assign the selected entries to a new project.
Once you’re done, click
Save
to apply the updates to all selected time entries.
Add tags to time entries
#
When updating time entries in bulk, you have two options for handling
tags
:
Existing tags will be replaced with the new tag you select
If you want to add a new tag
without replacing
the old one, check the
Add to existing
option. This will allow multiple tags to be assigned to the same time entry.
Mark time entries as favorites
#
This feature is available with paid plans.
For easier access to frequently used time entries, you can
mark them as favorites
:
Use the checkboxes to select the time entries you want to mark as favorites
Choose the option to mark those entries as
favorites
Save
This allows you to quickly access and track commonly used time entries in the
Time tracker
.
Additionally manage time entries
#
Move time entries between workspaces
#
This is a paid feature and requires the workspace to be upgraded.
If you need to transfer time entries from one workspace to another, you can do so using the
Import timesheet
feature:
In the
Detailed report
, choose the date range and any necessary filters, then export the report as a
CSV
file
Log into the destination workspace where you want to move the time entries
Go to
Settings > Import
and upload the CSV file
Follow the prompts to start the import process
Delete time entries
#
If you need to remove a time entry, follow these steps:
Select time entry
Click the three dots on the right side of the time entry you want to delete
Confirm by clicking
Delete
If you accidentally delete a time entry, you can
undo
the action by following the steps below.
Undo a deleted time entry
#
If you are working in bulk and accidentally delete the wrong entry, you will be able to restore it with the
Undo
option.
If you delete a time entry by mistake, you can easily undo the action:
After you confirm the deletion, a
toast notification
will appear at the bottom of the screen with an
Undo
button
You have 10 seconds to undo the deletion
After you click
Undo,
the entry will be restored, including all data (e.g. project, tags, time spent).
Best practices
#
When working with a large number of entries, it’s helpful to filter your data by project, user, or date before selecting entries to edit. This ensures you only update the time entries you need to change.
Bulk edits cannot be undone unless you use the
Undo
feature immediately. Always double-check the values you’re updating before saving to avoid mistakes.
If you frequently use tags for categorizing time, ensure they’re consistently applied across your workspace.
