Best rated timekeeping software
4.8 (out of 5) rating, based on 9,000+ reviews.
★★★★★
Excellent, Excellent, Excellent
I have been using it for a week now and rolling it out to our 7 person team. Response has been very good. The software answers the 3 key questions we have about our team. 1.) What did you work on today? 2) How much time have you been spending on any one project? 3) What projects are in the mix? Having the ability to mark billable vs. non-billable is a feature we will use as well. It had all the features I needed AND NONE of the ones I did not want. So it was not un-necessarily complicated. Thus the ease of use and intuitive nature of the software was excellent. The free price tag for these basic functions was a bonus. Overall, perfect for our needs.

Never fail to bill your clients ever again
Clockify is ideal for my needs. I work part-time for a client working as his executive assistant and his bookkeeper. I was getting myself in a mess just using a timesheet created in MS Excel and when I discovered Clockify I was over the moon with joy. I keep Clockify open in the background and I switch projects when I start the work and when I finish the work. I used to under invoice for my time and lose income but now I can bill for every second I work on his projects. Also, it has great reporting function and can either print off or save as a PDF or Excel etc. So not only do I invoice my client, I've also got exact data for the time I carry out each of his tasks.

Great time tracking software, cheap cost, high vlaue
Value for money is insane. The free plan by far meets all my needs. Reporting. Detailed timing. Many projects and clients. When I upscale to team plan too the pricing is super competitive. I've recently switched ~1month ago and don't regret it at all, Clockify misses no features I need and add more than I need too.
— Rob G.
★★★★★
Easy and straightforward time tracking
Clockify has a polished UI that makes it enjoyable to use. I divide my working hours between several internal and external projects that are both billable and non-billable. Each project/client can be assigned a different hourly rate. I prefer to use the mobile app for starting the timer but the browser extension is also very helpful. I really enjoy the monthly reports. Recently I started to track also my leisure activities such as jogging and reading.

Perfect for tracking our employees' hours
We needed a better way to keep track of everyone's time, projects, and budgets in one place. Enter, Toggl! It seemed like a dream come true except.. you had to pay per month and per person! There was no way our little company could afford that. As a company just starting to get off the ground, we need every penny we can spare and a good way to track our employees' hours and project investments. Now that Clockify timesheet app is available, i have even higher hopes for our company's success this year.

Super easy to use
Extremely easy to use, ability to create unlimited clients and projects. Chrome web extension is always a click away.

Best Time Tracking Software I've Ever Used
I have run the gamut of time tracking software to manage my business of 60 or so writers. This is the first one I've used that is bug free, easy to use on both the management and user end, and simple to understand. I wish I had found this software 10 years ago when I began my business. Oh the frustration I could have saved using some of the older time trackers.
— Joy L.
★★★★★
Easy for staff to use
Easy for staff to use and enter times against projects, good reporting options to export to excel spreadsheets, reliable program and their support centre is always prompt when answering queries.
— Lynette R.
★★★★★
Helped me to get organized and stopped me from losing money
I had always the problem to do to many favors. A logo here, a little code there. I did not realize how much time I wasted until I started using Clockify. I did try a couple of other apps but none was that easy and offered similar tools. Once I got everything ready and started counting my hours I fast figured out how much I actually needed Clockify. The times of lost hours are gone. I have a clear overview and know with a couple of clicks how much time I spend on each project and even know what my client has to be charged. In a couple of days Clockify turned into one of my favorite tools and I use it now every single day. Incredible easy and fast to use. Tools for every platform I needed from Android over Mac OS to Windows I use them all. Fair pricing.
— Oliver K.
★★★★★
Wish I hand found Clockify Sooner
Intuitive and simple to use, having used spreadsheets for years for all staff recording and monitoring hours, then invoicing from then, Clockify makes it quicker, simpler, and better for analysing the data and time spent on tasks than is possible from the spredsheet way. Great piece of software that saves time and in money and ongoing snapshot assessments of billable and unbillable hours is superb
— Jez T.
★★★★★
Great free app
I love that even though I use Clockify is a free product, it can do so many things. I can use it to track not only my total hours but also the hours I spend on specific projects. Then I can log in and see graphs and reports.
— Linda H.
★★★★★
Clockify is a productivity life saver!
The user interface is fantastic. You're able to put in a project name and client, which is helpful when multiple projects belong to the same client under separate billing. Additionally, I love that I can see the exact times I worked on specific projects. It's incredibly valuable to my productivity daily and I really don't know how I'd live without it. My company pays for a time tracking software, and I still choose to use Clockify.
— Lindsay K.
★★★★★
Excellent project management tool
Ease of use, no downtime on website, easy reporting with a wide variety of reports. Excellent user experience, allows for tracking of projects, ensuring costing of projects are accurate i.e. the number of man hours is tracked to ensure the forecast was correct.
— Michael C.
★★★★★
The best work companion
Really easy to use. Unlike most time tracking software, this one is built and centered around at most maybe 3 buttons, so I got started with it right away. Due to its simplicity, even the free trial gives you all the functionality you'd mostly need. Integration with Google Calendar. I am an active user of Google Calendar, and connecting Clockify to GCal through Zapier saved me valuable time every single day updating my daily schedule with Clockify entries. Works perfectly. Great reporting capability. Overall, great. Clockify really helped and still helps me with managing my busy daily life.
— Rafael S.
★★★★★
Exactly what I needed!
It's super efficient to track tasks. I love how easy it is to organize my work with various different projects and clients, and being able to quickly hit "stop" and "continue" has made my time tracking much more accurate. I work highly irregular hours, so time tracking has always been a challenge for me. I tend to start, pause, and stop at random times and this makes it very difficult to estimate how much time I've actually spent working on something. Clockify has made this infinitely easier and so much more efficient. Thank you!
— Katelyn S.

Excellent
Excellent product for tracking time spent on an activity. Worth the money. Easy reporting, good interface, etc. A must-have product for all types of companies.
— Sankaralingam S.

Straight to the point and easy time tracker!
It's very straightforward with the tracking system, and I love that you can either use the timer or add in the hours manually. The reports and dashboard give great graphics to review your progress which you can filter by different values, it's very useful. As a freelancer it is vital to keep track of my work on all the projects I do for billing accuracy, managing my time and future planning.
— Laura R.
★★★★★
Helps with billing
Its web based and I can log into it irrespective of where I am. As a bookkeeper I work for a lot of different clients it helps me keep track of who Im working for and the hours I have worked for which company. Helps me with my billing processes.
— Lisa C.
★★★★★
Easy to use, Efficient and User Friendly
No one had to show me how to use the software. It's incredibly easy to track my time and separate it by departments. I have had nothing but positive experiences with Clockify. It helps keep me on track and on top of my hours.
— Susanna S.
★★★★★
Great Product for employers
Great way to track the hours of multiple employees at multiple jobs doing multiples duties. Easy to personalize. Easy to use by all employees. Easy to invite anyone into the program. Really happy with the program and what it offers so far. I look forward to it's growth and seeing where it goes in the future. It really takes some stress off of my shoulders.
— Gavin P.
★★★★★
A great tool to keep track of time and hold yourself accountable
One of the best productivity tools out there, especially if you want to hold yourself accountable for procrastinating. Plus, it can keep track of time even if you close the browser window instead of auto-stopping. It's online so you don't have to rely on a specific software installed on a particular OS (in case you dual-boot and do work on multiple OS'es).
— Shirish K.
★★★★★
Clockify: a real time saver in reporting times
It is very intuitive and easy to use. I have not had any trouble using it so far. It saves so much time when reporting my work time. I would much rather do this than to fill out an Excel spreadsheet or handwrite work time on a paper form.
— Wonjun Y.
★★★★★
Tried many time tracking apps... Clockify is the best
What I liked most about Clockify is how easy and intuitive it is to use . Plus, the variety and quality of reporting options is awesome. I am seeing easily how I'm spending my time. The data in the various reports is so helpful. I can see what projects in general are taking the bulk of my time, and then being able to see the top 10 tasks gives an even deeper insight. I downloaded several time tracking apps, and I quickly became a fan of Clockify and deleted my accounts in the others.

★★★★★
Clockify is great!
We needed a better software for our hourly employees to track their time and day. I like the ease of clocking in daily and assigning myself to different task. It gives me a good picture of my day. I also like that even if you close the window or your computer it still tracks time.
— Taylor P.

Excellent Time Tracking Without Billing
Clockify is a wonderful app to help with time and project management. This is especially useful for contract and commission workers to keep track of progress and hours logged. Simple UI is easy to get accustomed with.
— Jessica J.
★★★★★
Life changer
Clockify offers so much value for no money at all. I love the search feature so I can see how I send time. This makes it easier for me to know how much to bid on similar jobs in the future. I had no idea how long projects took me before I got clockify. Now thanks to the graphs and charts, I see where my time is going, so I can optimize it.
— Marisa E.

The best app to track your time
The interface is very easy to use, the app provides integrations with multiple devices and it gives great graphs for you to analyse. It's a great app for sure.
— Luan C.
★★★★★
Startup Solution
I love how this platform allowed me to transition from a one-(wo)man show to being able to track team member hours. The reports give me a great way to really evaluate if I'm pricing well enough for the time of work being put in. Love that. Overall, I have really enjoyed using it.
— Jacqueline J.
★★★★★
Clockify makes tracking hours a piece of cake
Any way you slice it, a free software program that works exceptionally well is as great as chocolate cake. I work for a small company, but I hope larger firms support Clockify as well. They are not charging smaller firms for this excellent time tracking option.
— Gail S.
★★★★★
Integrated tracking
It's a free software available both for desktop and mobile so that's a huge plus for me. On top, it's a clean & simple design, just type in the task and start the counter. Tags and associated projects are good for reporting and keeping track of overtime.
— Adi R.
★★★★★
Powerful app with great potential
Simplicity, multi-platfrom and useful reports. I use this app for everyday time tracking. I love it for its simplicity. To start timer I just press 'play' and add title. No other actions. I can start work But if I need to change title or start/end time, then I can do it in 2 clicks. From any device or browser. It's great!
— Evgeny N.
★★★★★
Great for Freelancers
For a small company, it's a great start for free. It is easy to switch from a timer to set times. I've been able to visualize how much time I spend on projects and create a new business plan based on that.
— Keith E.
★★★★★
Simple Tracking for the Serial Part Timer
It is so easy for me to manage any number of projects and quickly get data to send invoices to clients. I simply click start and stop and don't have to worry about anything else. Overall extremely pleased with the use of this tool. Not only can I track my time, but I can easily edit times, create reports, and in general manage my time on the constantly growing number of pojects I have to manage.
— Heidi M.
★★★★★
Great for what I need
I love how easy it is to keep a record of daily tasks. I also love that you can start a timer and name it later without stopping the timer. I love that you can restart the timer after a break and that it is so simple to use. Overall, great for time tracking! Great job with this in the browser and the app.
— Jenna D.
★★★★★
Effective tool for time management
That it helped me know where i'm taking more time on certain projects and where i am more efficient. It helped me manage my time and pull a report i can show my supervisor. Overall, I loved the experience of using this time tracker. it helped me see where i am wasting time or taking longer than usual, and it helped me stay on track. I was able to present reports to the team, in meetings, and present it to other collegues.
— Jorge N.
★★★★★
Easy clocking of time with good reporting
Easy to keep track of my different activities. Then run a report to remind myself what I did and for which client/project. I bill clients for some activities and not other activities. I need to keep track of all my activities and this makes it easier to keep track.

No more whiteboard lists!
Ease of use. How much it helps us to keep track of jobs and projects. We use to have a whiteboard where we tried to keep track of all of our current and pending jobs. It was a major chore to keep up to date. My office is in another area, so I couldn't see the whiteboard unless I was in our production area. Clockify has greatly streamlined and simplified our workflow. It's easy to use and keep up to date.
— Rich D.
★★★★★
The ease of use and the flexibility is awesome
I have tried and used many time software before. The developing team has got everything so nice in place that after 2 years I have nothing to complain about. Thanks so much for this super program.
— Dries A.
★★★★★
Track and document time spent on projects with ease!
Start and stop is just a simple button. I needed a simple way to track projects and the time spent on each. It's a great product. If I forget to turn off the time, I can go back and plug in the specific times and it updates that time. If I forget to turn it on, it sends me simple reminders.
— Lou Ann R.
★★★★★
Only time is worth
I love an ability to see spent time over the each task in such easy and comfortable way as it is in Clockify. Every time I see bugs - I'm write to support and they eliminate it pretty quickly in near updates. I've solve my biggest problem with time management and it helped me to conquer the procrastination

Simple and gets the job done
It's very straightforward, lightweight, and uncomplicated. It does exactly what I need it to do. It's helping me quickly and easily track my time so that I can understand how much value i am getting out of every project.
— Will M.
★★★★★
Brilliant Features!
I love simple the software is to use. Normally when I start a new software I already want to leave because it's so complicated to use. this is as simple as it gets without losing functionality and I could use it straight away. I especially like that I could get most of the functionality that I needed to for free. I was so excited with my experience that I printed a report just to show my manager. She is now also interested in the software and is potentially looking to see how it could integrate in our work environment. Over all I am so grateful to beable to see what I'm doing with my day. I have 4 "hats" that I wear at work and sometimes I fee l like I dont get enough done. I also feel like I'm just wasting my time. Ever since using Clockify I can look back on my day and actually see everything I've accomplished. This motivates me to get more productive and I leave work feeling lighter rather than frustrated. I also love that I can integrate it with a lot of my favourite apps, although I haven't actually really used the integrations, but I'm also just starting out so that might change as I get more organised. I am so thankful for this software! Thank you so much! Definitely a game changer! Looking forward to using it with my studies next year!

Amazing tool to track time on tasks, motivate, and increase productivity
I love it all the fact that you can break it all into owners, projects topics , modify the times when needed, excellent I have recommended it to everyone that complains about their productivity, which is everyone!
— Carolina B.
★★★★★
Best time tracking tool I've used to date
Its really easy to use, has simple project and customer attribution and really good quality reporting. Keeping track of work across multiple different projects, some billed out to 3rd parties. Having a simple and easy to use way to record time spent and then where necessary produce billing reports was important. Had used previous tools before like Harvest but these were expensive and not as flexible. The visual reports really help to assess the best allocation of time and make adjustments on a weekly and monthly basis.
— Dominique H.
★★★★★
Clockify helps us keep track of time!
We have tried different types of time-tracking software, but none were as good and easy to use and implement. It's nice that you can use the free version with unlimited users, we will definitely upgrade in the future, but it's nice that we can already use almost every feature in the meantime. We did already recommend this app to other businesses!
— Emiel G.
★★★★★
Clockify Is Worth the Time... Literally
It genuinely helps keep track of my work. Without it, I would struggle to justify my hours and in turn, my company could not bill our clients efficiently.
— Austin L.
★★★★★
Time tracking
Pros: the flexibility of the program, the layout and quality of the reports. It is really good looking and frankly i dont think any of the competitors come even close to this flexibility you have. And it solved our tracking problems, and the report which we usually send with the bill to our customer is really nice.
— Frank E.
★★★★★
By far the best free time tracking software I have tested
It is easy to understand, to add projects and tasks and track the time. It is for free, but when taking into account the features and design it offers, you wouldn't think so. I have tried several free and also paid time tracking softwares to manage and track the time spent on different projects, but Clockify was the first and only that really persuaded me to use it in the long run.
— Maria S.
★★★★★
It does the job
The tagging system in the time tracker and resume option from a past record. It helped me to know how much time I spend on a product in designing, research and so on. It's simple but must have one if you are in a startup.
— Romio J.
★★★★★
Ease of tracking hours for internship
I was a student intern for a project on my campus which required me to work from home, on campus, and just about wherever I was during each day of the week. I was responsible for the social media side of an initiative, and that meant I had to create copy/respond to emails/be in communication with people all around my city. Clockify was able to work on my iPad (that I use for taking notes), desktop, and android phone - which allowed me to easily keep track of my hours no matter the time of day/place I was at. We needed a free utility for my timesheet, and it fit the bill perfectly. I've even used it for other personal projects/freelance jobs since then because of the impression it left on me.
— Sarah M.
★★★★★
Simple and Easy to Use
Clockify helps me to keep track of how much time I spend on each project I work on and therefore see if I charged the client properly and how much I should charge in the future. Pros: 1. short learning curve - easy to use 2. easy to see how much time I spent on a project in total, to see if it was profitable or not
— Deena E.
★★★★★
Sliced Bread!
The ease of use is overwhelming. Feature right usually falls to the wayside when easy to use jumps at you. Not here, the level of intuitiveness is married quite nicely to the abundance of features. The old adage time is money couldn't be truer in my industry.
— Patrick S.
★★★★★
Seamless Time Tracking!
So easy to integrate, understand and organize. Clockify is an exceptional tool that enables maximum productivity through analytical reporting, organization and collaboration.
— Mike F.
★★★★★
Clockify was the time tracking solution we'd been looking for!
Firstly, the free access made selecting Clockify so easy. Next, it was the integration with our project management tool Clubhouse was the next no brainer for our team. Clockify is so easy to use and as an administrator, it's so simple and straightforward for me to view and report on our team's hours. There were a few bugs when we first signed up to use Clockify, but the response we got from support whenever we hit a snag was so helpful and involved. It only improved our experience!
— Victoria B.
★★★★★
Look no further
It's simple, it's intuitive, it tracks time like I need it (as a stopwatch and as a time sheet), I can edit entries (which is helpful when I get a phone call that takes me off track), the reporting is clean and insightful, it fits my budget as a single person LLC startup without compromising anything. It's fantastic. Clockify does exactly what I need it to in a simple and user-friendly format. I can track my time like a stopwatch, or enter my time after the fact. The reports pull in billable, and non-billable hours so I am confident when I bill my clients that I am presenting the most accurate information possible. It keeps me accountable and helps me feel confident that I have earned what I have earned and that I am worth the compensation. I worked in a large corporation where I had to track time for 10 years and never ever had something this straightforward. LOVE it.
— Sarah F.S.

Just easy
I found the tool so helpful in breaking up my time. I have always had problems time sheeting small tasks and jumping between clients. Within about a week of using clockify I was ontop of my time sheeting.

Awesome Software for Project Planning

Does what it says it will do!
Simple to use and flexible enough to track time for multiple clients/projects/tasks. Good report graphics and data output (e.g. to input to invoicing software). Very easy to implement and setup. Installed and began using almost immediately.

★★★★★
Clockify has become a daily habit
It literally takes just 2 clicks to start tracking my time when I begin my workday: open the desktop app and click a button. Clockify makes time tracking super easy. My clients are loving the detailed reports where they can see everything I've been up to.

Clockify Review
Ease of use was the first thing I was looking for, and I found it. My company, Alexander Street Press, used a time system from another company. When the company was bought by ProQuest they discontinued the company-sponsored time system and left us on our own to find a substitute. One of the members of the Semantic database indexing team recommended Clockify, and about ten of us started to use it
— Rossinna I.

Track, analyze and monitor your activities for better productivity.
Ease of use and onboarding. Simple and fast interface. We were using it 5 minutes after signing up with no issues. We love that we can add time tracked manually.

The best time tracker
Simple but not underpowered. Has most (if not all) of the functions on pricier and premium services. At the same time, it's the easiest to use on your current workflow.
— Jose Manuel V.
★★★★★
Free but awesome!
It's easy to use and has great free features. I really like this service, it gets the job done. I am in charge of keeping track of my own hours, I tried other free services but none fit the bill until Clockify! I use the free version and while other free services are extremely limited Clockify has awesome free features that really allows its users to get the job done. Clockify is limitless!
— Bianca V.
★★★★★
For free? What's not to love?
I own a small, niche accounting firm with one employee three time zones away. And while most of my fees are fixed, we often take on "projects" for which we bill by the hour. Clockify lets my track our hours down to any "sub level" I need. It's perfect for me to track my admin time as well, so I know when it's getting close to me needing to hire an additional person. It's perfect for what I need. I use ClickUp (another great product) for task/project management. And, although it has an internal "time clock", it's weak. However, Clockify was one of the recommended integrations. It integrates perfectly with ClickUp and since it resides in clickup as well, we can start and stop it by task in ClickUp. Kinda remarkable.
— Michael A.
★★★★★
Clockify is amazing
Clockify is obviously the product of someone that wanted to do something right. Everything about it, from the user interface to the report generation and user management is done with an eye in making it stable and pleasant. Clockify is the perfect solution for our start-up. I could not ask for a better time tracking solution for our company.

Best software for tracking time worked!
It is so easy to use and make corrections. It keeps track of time worked even if you forget to stop the clock. Time adjustments are so easy and you can print a report weekly or monthly. That's how I bill my client, so there's no haggling about the hours worked. It gives precise information about the time and hours you work. You can even label different projects as you work on them, so you can keep track of how much time is spent on each project. My client runs a small business. I have worked on various projects for her including data entry, marketing, uploading product photos and product descriptions, assisting her with managing her website, etc. I was able to track the time spent on each project by simply clocking in and out and using the labels. At the end of the month, she was amazed at how I was able to help her understand the breakdown of each project with the simple push of a button.
— JoAnn P.
★★★★★
It's awesome!
I like that you can write the task you are working on. Then when you are working on a new task, you can easily start the clock again for that task. It is so easy to navigate and keep track of the tasks I'm working on. Plus, let's say that I want to change the task description, I can easily modify it. I love it!! I've been able to save a lot of time in invoicing clients because of the way I'm able to write the tasks in real time. That's the biggest benefit so far for me, the time saving aspect and ease of use.
— Sheila Z.

Accurate Time-Keeping & Billing with Clockify
Clockify is simple to use and is accurate. Before Clockify, I would underestimate how much time it would take to complete a project and under bill for it. With Clockify, I am able to accurately track my time and bill accordingly. Clockify has saved me and our business time and money! Clockify is a terrific timekeeping option to accurately account for billable time!
— Jennifer T.
★★★★★
Perfect tool
Ease of use for tracking time and reporting on time. Clockify is so easy to use! You can quickly and easily add clients, create projects, and track time. I also love the Chrome extension that makes it so easy and convenient to track time.
— Julie S.
★★★★★
Can't ask for more from a free version
I live the ease of use and the fact that you don't truly need to keep a tab open for it as it relies on cookies also to track time (i suppose).Adjusting tracked time is also easy. Straightforward . Took me a few minutes to set up and from there it's very easy to use all features including reports or any other edits you might need to do. Click click and done. Clockify helped me with being able to track the time I work for my clients without having to pay anything. This is very useful especially when starting out and not having budget for almost anything. Not being forced to upgrade to Premium until your business reaches a certain level that requires or benefits from the perks of Premium is great.
— Robert K.
★★★★★
Game Changer!
Detailed downloadable reports to supply to my clients so they know how their money is being spent. Before Clockify, I had trouble accounting for time I spent working on client projects. Manual spreadsheets did not work for me. I like having Clockify right there on my desktop. This has been a game changer AND really a life changer for me. Thanks for what you do and for being independent. That's awesome.

Easiest way of tracking your working times
The easy setup and the fast and non-complicated process of starting a new timer. My benefits are to track specific working times on projects. Also as a freelancer i am able to record my times and give them a number or title to manage them all.
— Benjamin H.
★★★★★
Easy Interface for Any User Level
We onboard new employees and interns quite frequently. There is no learning curve to this program and it is easy for us to get new people up and running, even ones who rarely use platforms outside of their normal routine. The tagging is very helpful in tracking various aspects of a project and helps when billing our clients.

Clockify Does Everything I Need
I love this software because it is so easy to use. I signed up and started using it immediately.

Great time management platform

I NEED to be able to keep track of my time and would love to have a keen assistant constantly at my elbow ... but I can't afford that right now. What I love most about Clockify is that its interface is elegant, uncluttered and inviting, super-easy to use. This means that I actually DO keep track of my time and my projects. And almost unbelievably: it's free! Despite being definitely better and easier to use than some of the paid programs I tried out via free trials. As an independent researcher, artist, video-biographer and trainer, my life can easily get complicated. I am passionate about all of my projects, so that time management and good organization are essential if I am to continue to do what I love. With Clockify, I keep my projects organized, can add an delete as necessary. The super-important dimension of keeping track of my time is made easy thanks to Clockify's clear interface and intuitive functionality. The reports allow me to sit back and reflect on how well I am balancing priorities.

Love this product!
It's easy to edit, has nice UI & UX, is organized well. If I need to change the time I clocked in or out, it can be easily done. If I need to categorize what projects I'm working on, it is easily done. I love the time feature where you can input your time without the colon (ie 730 instead of 7:30). Love it! I work remotely and part-time so it's a great way to track my hours and projects I'm working on

Exactly what I was looking for!
I love the reports and being able to see a breakdown of exactly what my team is working on. The Graph makes it super easy to see what projects and where they are spending the most time to, later on, improve our efficiencies. We send a report over to our clients so they can see the value of the work we have done for them. It has helped us retain clients.

Huge fan of Clockify!
The free version of this software kicks butt - super easy to use and user-friendly, love the reporting capabilities. Helps me out a lot. The app is great as well. Have become better at understanding my time management, my hourly rates for different clients, and the average length of time spent on different projects, which has helped me with pricing structures.

My love for Clockify
I love the platform because of the ease of use and the fact that the interface is user-friendly. I have personally recommended Clockify to my clients and they love it too. The best part is that right on the dashboard for time tracking, I can easily select the client and project that I want to start or continue. As a Virtual Assistant, I do have clients that bill me by the hour and wants a breakdown of what I do on a daily basis and clockify has helped me create awesome reports for those clients.

Good work time tracker
The most positive is the price - it's free to use with many features available. It's nice GUI, where it's easy to find what you need. I like it very well. When I have been searching for an toggl alternative, I found clockify and tested it. Since I have started using it, I'm very satisfied. It has many toggl paying features in its free variant, so I have most features that I need available for me.

A very easy to use time tracker to cover many projects as a freelancer
The interface is nice, the reports get me what I need for invoicing. I can tag any recorded time as billable or not billable and even enter the dollar amount. I tag entries for specific clients or types of work with various colors which helps differentiate entries. The weekly emailed report helps me make sure my time is on point. I previously used Toggl, which I like just fine, but was a bit limited on the free version, and I didn't like the interface that much. I tried Clockify just to see how it would go, and so far I like it and am sticking with it for the near future.

No strings attached
Clockify is device-independent, cloud-based, flexible enough to accommodate all needs that a professional or a small group of independent consultants may have. What I really like about it, though, is that it comes with no strings attached: all basic and intermediate features are free and have stayed free since I started using it some months ago. Premium functions are "nice-to-have" features that you may or may not subscribe to, without impacting your ability to take full profit of Clockify's basic and intermediate functions. Clockify's multiplatform nature means that you can access it from everywhere, so you really don't have excuses for lagging behind with your billing activities! Queries can be exported into an Excel file that you can use to generate invoices, streamlining the whole process. Plus, it is intuitive and easy to learn (no handbook required), so that freelancers can stay focused on their business, not on their billing software!

So Easy and Accurate!
It is very easy to keep track of my hours on different projects, which makes it easy as an independent contractor to complete requests for payments and is a very efficient way to manage my projects.

The fact that it works online and on various platforms (Mac, PC, mobile.etc) is great for someone who moves around a lot.

Focusing on work not the clock
This product is beautiful in its simplicity of design. It represents exactly what I was looking for and needed for time tracking and also time management.

Straighforward time tracker
Simplicity - It's a straightforward time tracking app that one actually uses. After trying different apps that I usually forgot to use regularly, or that offer too few or too many features I stumbled upon this app that is easy to use, offer just the features that you need (such as projects, analytics) and that are easy to use both through web browser and on the phone I finally managed to keep track of the time spent during the day over different projects. If you click on any task that you previously tracked it will start another tracking instance which is really beneficial for repetitive tasks and tasked stopped due to interruptions. As I work on multiple projects at the same time it is usually very difficult to pinpoint how time is spent during a regular working day. After starting using the app regularly i.e. having a tab regularly open and using Android app always when on the go (meetings, etc.) I got a clear picture of how time is spent and which projects are regularly taking "invisible time" ie. time that is not billed. After setting up basic projects and tagging each activity with a project I can get basic overview of how I am spending my time at a glance. I don't need to submit my time sheet to anyone, so I am not using the reports as much, but I see this as a very useful feature for freelancers. The user interface is simple and focuses on one single thing - and switching between the web app - tab in the browser and the app on the phone is without any problems. Another thing worth mentioning is integration with gmail - so each time I get something via email that will take more than 2 min to complete I could just click on the button within the gmail and start tracking time for that task - for me it meant really understanding how much all those "little tasks" actually take. In a way I also use this as a log for what I've done and to see if I am meeting the goals I set to myself such as 'spending more time on product development instead on operational things', since at the end of a week you have a clear view of whether you actually did what you've said you would focus on.

Very useful, free time tracker
Clockify is very easy to get started with and use. It is great that it has a free plan as most time trackers don't. Being able to see daily and weekly timesheet is very helpful. You can use Clockify for basic time tracking or more complex working using projects. I wasn't tracking time before so didn't really know what I was spending on projects. Clockify helps me to see whether projects are profitable and where I need to make efficiencies.

Good and easy to use tracker
Easy to use. Not required to go through any rigorous training. Free tool. Option of billable and non-billable. Reports and dashboards.

Clockify is one of the best time tracker on the market

Helps with time management and payroll
Clockify lets us organize staff schedules across multiple projects, stories, and editing jobs. We're a newspaper so we have a lot of different projects happening at once, Clockify lets us keep track of timesheets for each project and staffer. Our newspaper has had tremendous success using Clockify to manage our projects and timesheets. Our staffers are paid fairly for their work on each project and we can personalize their salary, which makes it more fair to the employees.

Best alternative in the market
Clockify combines every useful feature from its competitors like Noko and Toggl, which makes this tool super powerful. Reporting and team management are really easy and straightforward. Also, it is really fast compared to competitors. We've been testing different tools such as Noko (Freckle) and Toggle, and for small teams, Clockify the best value in a free plan. Here, managing team (without size limit) is very easy, especially the ability to assign employee's hourly rate.

A simple way to track your time
I work for a small business so we do not necessarily need a huge piece of software for tracking our time and running billing like Harvest.

Clockify has simplified my timekeeping
Clockify has democratized timekeeping for business. I've used a number of applications over the years to track my time on hourly-based projects, but they were complicated to use and didn't provide thorough enough reporting. Clockify has made setup and use simple, and I love the fact that it can live on my computer with access to my full account online with real-time reporting and tracking. The fact that it is free to use is the icing on the cake. As a solopreneur, I absolutely appreciate access to full-featured software without having to add yet another subscription, at least until I'm sure the software provides what I need. I'm completely sold on. It has made time tracking seamless, quick and easy in a way that other timekeeping options did not, particularly for my retainer clients who pre-pay for blocks of time.  Clockify.

Easily track and report on all your time
So easy to use! I have it bookmarked so I can quickly start time tracking new tasks - whether that's billable time, on non-billable time. I like that I can set up specific tasks but also include notes with specific time entries. I track billable hours for multiple client projects, breaking down tasks to get the best sense of where I spend my time. For my flat-fee retainer clients, this allows me to see where my time is going to make sure my time is best spend and those arrangements are profitable. For my hourly-billed clients, this lets me accurately bill clients for time spent on their projects.
— Karie P.
★★★★★
A Lifesaver
The ease of use is probably the best feature. The chrome extension allows me to start my timer from emails and calendar events which is the most helpful option in my line of work. As a consultant, I'm switching gears as often as every 15 minutes and Clockify makes this possible and simple. I have to keep track of my billable time, which when you're billing by the 1/4 hour, that has the potential to be a lot of entries in a day. Before Clockify, I was hand-writing all my entries in a notebook which was both time consuming and often forgotten, leaving me to frantically try to recall what I did weeks earlier. Truly, Clockify has been my saving grace.

Clockify Review 2021
Clockify has a very friendly user interface which makes it easy to use and pick up. It also records the exact time for each project when you click Start/Stop.

Working smarter than my colleagues
Having to track your hours worked is a common chore for us software types. This makes it very easy. My clients are all internal so I don't use the billing features but I can see how this would make a freelancer's life much easier. Great app! Pros: That it's a web app. I work from several different workstations over the course of a week. I love that I can clocking my hours for a project at one location, go to another location, stop the clock and start it for a new task. The built in reporting features are wonderful. 90% of what you want as user and as an administrator and push button options and bam! Data.

Time tracking made simple
This has very nice interface and after configuring it makes operation very simple. Making a new entry is very easy and also quick to make work more productive.Billing feature is useful here as you can set by default a billing price for your given time, each project is priced differently, set bill time to project and it will apply the charges in rates it has or the default . We can collect all generated data of reports. Charts provide a lucid view whereas tables enhances readability. Project sharing distributes work and makes work easier, this exactly is the means by which we can log time of our teams and are being able to decide if the time is billable or not. The filters work expected and searches are better. Our billing clients loved it and we too made achievable targets with clockify in position to make us responsible to time. It providds reliable form of tracking and now team can not make excuses for missing deadlines. Also we don't need much of knowledge about it's UI as most things are readymade. Though we can agree on a point that dashboard is not as simple as it should have been, which can definitely change the future course of clockify.

Fast and Easy to Use!
Entering a timer is fast. This is the most important aspect of the product for me. If entering my time is some involved process that makes me fill out dozens of fields, I would probably just skip it. With Clockify, I just enter the start/stop time, a description, and an optional category. Fantastic. I use Clockify for all of my personal projects as well. I also emailed support a typo, and it was fixed within a couple days. Very fast turnaround.

Perfect for team that work with multiple projects and clients
Ease of use. with the chrome extension, the team is able to track time in a much easier way, and this makes our data more reliable. Having different user groups is great to avoid having users seeing projects that are not assigned to them. We started using clockify because we have a lot of clients and we couldn't estimate the time and cost we spent with each one of them. Clockify is helping us to track the amount of time we spend working for every client and this allows us to understand better their profitability.

Perfect time tracking tool for our small team
We used Toggl in the past, though it became pricey for us. Depending on our current needs, we use free and premium version of Clockify and both are working very well for us.

One more gamechanger for us was possibility to share time tracking report per project/client - perfect solution to allow clients to keep an eye on progress and costs.

Top tool for freelancers!
I can time everything that I'm working on, choose the clients and budgets and as it has apps for mobile and ipad, I can turn it one wherever I am. Being able to export pdf reports filtered by project, client, billability, makes it super easy for me to understand the time I'm spending in each work and, therefore, I can make very precise invoices afterwards. It completely eased my workflow! And the free version is super complete and perfect for my size of projects. But actually I think it should be useful in any size of company!

Clockify has greatly improved our business
Before discovering Clockify we had no idea of how long we were spending on each event. Now we know and the results have been very interesting.

Now we know and it will help us to price jobs more accurately in the future.

Best time and task management tool I have used

Clockify has all the features I need (reporting, projects, tags, ability to create billable and non-billable entries, and apps to support use anywhere.

One and only solution for your time tracking needs
I have tried number of time tracking softwares and got bored with each one, 1. Some has good features, but may lack in usability, 2. Some has good features, great usability, but expensive, 3. Some has everything more than needed (over engineered), which totally spoils the usability, (ex: for each entry I need to fill a very big form, unwanted notifications, useless statistics) Finally I decided to write my own time tracker, at that time I got suggestion about Clockify from my friend, so I thought to give it a try, I frustrated already and started using Clockify without trust, but I really surprised. It simply works, and solved my needs. 1. It has simple user interface, which gives great usability, 2. Very simple to add an entry, very flexible in time entry, 3. Provides manual tracking and tracking with a timer, 4. Clean categorization, and tagging is nice, 5. Option for making an entry as billable 6. Simple reports

Productivity booster
It was really easy to set up for my team of employees. The option to add our clients was simple to figure out and quick and easy to update. We were also able to better track the time spent on each client doing the specific job we needed to do. In addition, our productivity has increase because we are no longer spending the extra time trying to calculate everything individually. This has been quick and easy! We have been able to solve the issue of not knowing who has done what work and for how long. With this software, we are able to view at a glance what has been done already and what we need to continue to work on. We are also able to see quickly the amount of money that has been made with each job which has cut down on the amount of time spent after our work day has ended.

How did I ever work before Clockify?
Wow, where do I begin! I think the dashboard is my absolute favorite! To be able to see exactly which month I had spent how many hours (and minutes!) working on which project helps me greatly to plan my workload and to priorities. Each time entry can be highly customized by connecting it to the relevant projects, giving it a very descriptive name and tagging it with special keywords. You can also mark every entry as payable or non-payable and for our company, where we use Clockify to pay our employees on a monthly basis, this and the rest of the features are indispensable! I have been using this product for many months and today I cannot see myself and my working day without Clockify. Every morning when I start, I press the button and know that my progress and work are properly recorded, under the corresponding project sections and descriptive headings & tags. If you need to track your and/or your team's workload, you will not make a mistake by switching to this great product!

Simple is good
I just find it so easy to use, both with logging the time and with getting reports. It's also easy to go back and clean up the entries. I overall really like it. Easy to get data into and back out of.

Great solution for non-profits
Clockify is a very versatile and user-friendly software. It is very intuitive and someone can begin using it almost immediately. My organization was considering ClickTime which was going to cost us much more than we were wanting to pay and proved to not be near as user-friendly. My husband, who is a program and project manager, overheard our conversation and directed us to Clockify. Within less than a day's use of both, we quickly decided Clockify was the better choice for us. The flexibility of being able to use multiple devices that sync up was a big plus, too, especially for those of us that are off-site a lot.

An invaluable tool for a price you can't argue with
Clockify is simple and easy to use, and importantly is also flexible. It's great that there are desktop and mobile applications, as well as the web application, so that you can track time in a way that is most convenient at the time. I often switch from logging my time as I complete a task and after I've completed tasks. The different ways of categorising time entries is also really useful, but for me one of the best features of Clockify is its ability to integrate with other web applications such as Trello and Google Docs - making it even easier to track time. The fact that an API is available is also brilliant. For me, Clockify has enabled me to improve my pricing structures by looking at how much I charge in comparison to the work I do currently versus what I would like that figure to be. It has also helped me to identify tasks that can either be optimised or made more efficient.

It is a great software to keep your action in check. How much time you've worked you can keep track. And many times I used to stay longer in office just because I didn't remember for how long I have been there. But not I leave the office at right time so that I have have some "Me time". Overall it is great till now. I had suggested some points which are certainly of my use. Using Clockify has improved quality of my time.

May be the best time tracker there is!
Clockify has been an essential tool for our team to track our team's time on a daily basis. Free version is very generous for a startup company, only upgrade when you need more features like branded reports. Cheaper than their competitors as it offers a per user payment only on their enterprise plan.

Great for University Team Management!
My university capstone team was having trouble being productive and using all of its time wisely. Clockify gave us an easy way to track money, allowing us to keep each other accountable, and we have already made significantly more progress than we were before. It is easy to use, and has great reporting features to monitor each sub-team's hours.

Clockify is amazing
I believe that the program is simply amazing! - It takes into account of the project and you can keep time down to the second - You can assign tags to the project and the thing your working on at the moment.

Best free time tracking for freelancers
I'm working as a freelance graphic designer with many clients and usually on many projects simultaneously. In most cases I bill my time to clients. Clockify helps me to easily track hours, and later see customised reports to create invoices. Invoices i create manually, i just need to see overall time spend on projects, tasks, and clients. All what i need for free. I was looking for this app for long time. It has a free plan, which has 99% of all functionality i need. It has a mobile app. It has a desktop app. Works on mac and windows.

The best time tracking app, period
Incredible number of QUALITY integrations. Very easy to use integrations that just appear where you need them when you need them. The user interface is highly intuitive, clean, and beautiful. The user experience is without friction. The reports are fantastic. Works everywhere I work across OS's, browsers, and apps. Clockify is one of my favorite apps. It is something I use and recommend every single day. I am definitely a Clockify enthusiast and am proud to have pushed for several integrations that are currently active. The team is very responsive and the development pace is excellent. They are also building a very nice community and share a lot of quality related content. This is one of my few 10 star apps.

Great value for an affordable price + constant development = successful software
Pricing scales with features instead of scaling with the number of users.

New features appearing every month or so are always pleasant news. Great and helpful customer support.

Must-use productivity software
I like that it calculates your worth based on the time spent on a project because I hate having to do the math. It also organizes projects, the client and you can easily stop the time tracker and come back where you left off without having to start all over again! So efficient for those work distractions! Benefits: Time-tracking is smoother; Productivity is easier to check back on; You can share progress with employer which is always needed.

A fantastic easy way to track time spent on clients' accounts

Better value than most of the time trackers
The best value for money you can get regarding the time trackers. I mean the features are maybe somewhat different, but it's not like we had any issue of switching to this. The transition to this was very easy. This allowed us to have everybody to track their time instead of us having to pay for extra users (which ends up costing exponentially more). Besides we didn't miss out on any features with regard to the competitors. At the end of the day you'd like people to track their time so it's easier for you to estimate, calculate or see where the time goes. And this allows that without having to pay an astronomically amount of money. If we need extra reporting features we will definitely be upgrading without having a hearth attack. Thank you for that.

Control over project activities and goals
It is very fast to use. I can input all my clients and projects. Can have a better idea of time spend on delivery activities. Can reach my daily based hourly goal. Can reach the projects time spending and qualify the time spend on productivity I work as a designer-creative freelancer, and the time i work is the money i get. So i must do not spend time on procastination or wondering so much. With Clockfy my freelancing job is transforming itself. It is very easy and fast to use, so i don't have to think so much on any process or table filling. So i can just type the job, click go and start doing. I´m solving a serious goal question, to spend the right amount of time on each project (that was planned and have a budget). And also a daily goal on spending working hours.

The services has Mac tracker, where you can do basically everything, from setting new projects, adding new clients, creating tags for better taxonomy. On the website I can see the time reports per client, project, etc. The Mac app also detects if I'm not working and asks if it should keep or delete that time. It's perfect for me for freelancing, even on the free tier. I am helping myself to understand the time I take for doing stuff that I was not used before. Also, helps me to charge for my services.

Works exactly like you'd hope, feature-rich, and has helped us realize profits
It is extremely intuitive. It's very easy to create new projects, set them as billable and non-billable, and separate your time so you can easily see how you're spending your time and determine if projects are profitable. The reporting is easy to pull, has great filters, and pretty (colored pie charts!) The free version is extremely feature-rich which means we can get fully invested in this tool now, and as we grow we know it will grow with us. We've had an amazing experience with Clockify, it filled a very needed hole in our agency for reporting on our time in a standard way across all team members. We can easily see where our time has gone in real-time, and timesheets are easily send by just doing a simple export of reports. We recommend it to every single business owner or entrepreneur we meet.

Clockify Increases Productivity
What I like most about Clockify is the ease of use. I like that I can log in from any device and quickly log my projects. The interface is intuitive and uncluttered. Many other project management softwares I tried were complex and crowded. When I want to quickly and easily track my work, Clockify delivers. The method to input projects and clients (color coding, drop-down menu) helps me to maintain organization and see my work at-a-glance. Having a visual report of my projects and tracking where my time is going has been highly valuable in assessing my input/output, decreasing wasted time, and increasing efficient work practices.

Great User Friendly Tool for Small Teams and Businesses
I love that the software is free, lightweight, and user friendly. I appreciate the multi-faceted organization of having clients, projects, tasks, tags, etc. It's easy to understand and allows for flexibility within the product setup. Additionally, the easy to access reports allow for quick review of time tracking data without having to export to another format. I started utilizing Clockify to add some clarity to the work of my company's small 3-person UX team. We wanted more insight into how we were utilizing our time. We work across products so we set up each product as a client, each project as a project within the client, and then create tasks to determine how much time we spent on design, research, meetings, etc. per project. Additionally, we've added tags for greater specificity within some of those tasks. This allows us to see a wide variety of information such as how many projects we've worked on in a given period, how long we spent in meetings vs. designing during a certain quarter, which products demand the most of our attention, etc.

Easy to use + Grows with you!
Pros: Easy logging of billable hours for employees/contractors. Assign variable pay rates to workers or different positions. Calculation of billable hours and total due making payroll easy! Integrations with Zapier such as QuickBooks allow for simple bookkeeping! Freemium model has great features in free plan, but paid plans help you as your company grows! I love how Clockify allows my contractors to independently log their billable hours for me to easily monitor and issue calculate payroll! My contractors make different rates for different types of work, so the ability to assign variable pay rates to workers AND to different positions is perfect for my needs. I am excited to try the integration with QuickBooks via Zapier to integrate it with my bookkeeping. Clockify's paid plans allow for you to access additional features which I plan to do in the near future as my business expands.

Clockify is a must for freelancer web developer
Pros: Easy of use for multiple projects and clients. I'm working on daily basis for at least 4 different clients and it's easy to manage time for all of them. If client asks for timesheet, I can easily generate clockify report for them. If I need to put fixed hours, clockify gives ability to do so. Overall experience with clockify I rate as 8.5/10. It's a must dev time logging tool. Even if your client doesn't tell you to log your time, it helps yourself to begin proper time management and see how much time you've spent on specific tasks.

My Overall Experience
As an end-user who uses this software every day, I'd say it's pretty simple to use and makes time tracking easy. My company decided to replace our previous time tracking software with Clockify just over two years ago and it didn't take long before the rest of the employees began using it. Credit should be given to its easy UI compared to the previous software we used which looked complicated and took some training. So overall I'd recommend this to business owners looking to make time tracking easy for their employees and themselves. Clockify makes it easier for folks at the company I work for and myself to generate a timesheet report for any specific period. Normally payroll would ask us for a monthly time report before they pay us so this comes in handy plus it's very simple to generate with just a few clicks.

Straightforward Time Tracking Software -- Easy to Learn, Easier to Use
There are two features that really stand out when it comes to Clockify. The first being its compatibility across a number of devices. I can track my time via the web app or desktop app while working from my home office, then just as easily use the mobile app to record how long I've spent working on my train ride into the city, all without having to worry about issues with syncing between my devices. The second feature that I absolutely love about Clockify is how granular it allows you to be when tracking your activities. You have complete control with the ability to create clients, assign projects to those clients, and even generate tasks within each project. And when it's time to use the tracker, just pick which project you want to track from the drop-down. The projects are separated by clients with submenus for each project displaying that project's tasks. You even have the option to add further description in the 'What are you working on?' field. This level of detail is critical when it comes to recording my time for invoicing purposes. On the other hand, if you need to just record the time and fill in the details later - you can do that too! As a software developer working on small projects while putting myself through school, I have to be very careful with how I manage my time. Clockify provides me with a great solution to keep myself accountable for my waking hours. With its feature to add clients, I'm able to record the time I spend studying separately from my work hours by listing my education institution under one client and my contracts under their own respective clients. The reporting feature is insightful in breaking down my time by my desired filters (date, client, project, task, etc.). It enables me to keep my clients happy with accurate progress reports and estimated completion dates as well as help me gauge my progress in my school's curriculum. Tracking my time using Clockify has definitely kept my life on track!

So easy to use I didn't have to see any tutorial

I used another tool for tracking time but lately it had bugs, so I was searching for another option and then I saw Clockify was used by a colleague and start using it since then. Reports also can be viewed with the filters I needed with ease. I liked to see reports clearly and it was easy to use. Now I can see visually and clearly how I am managing my time with no stress

Fantastic, free, invaluable
Clockify is an amazing tool that allows us to not only track projects, but also track the amount of hours individuals spend on these projects, which makes things so much easier if you're paying by the hour. It tracks project progress and allows us to make schedules and make sure our teams are on track, and also allows us to tabulate billable hours. It's easy to use, and everyone is happy with the user interface. You can choose billable vs nonbillable hours, and it makes our payment system so much less of a headache. All in all a wonderful tracking and billing tool which keeps us on top of our project goals while also making it a breeze to track billable hours for payment.

Best time tracker software I've ever used
It's so easy to use! You can start tracking time before you've entered the task, it collates all time for each task per day so you don't have a list of 10 time entries for the same task, it's clear and easy to see how much time you've spent on each task and every day - I love it! I've tried quite a few time tracking options over the years, free and paid, and Clockify beats them all hands down.

Great option for tracking time spent on various work streams
Deployment was a breeze, documentation on their website is excellent, and customer service has been good. For example, a few team members experienced a bug at one point, and after we sent them the details, they offered workarounds and got it fixed in a reasonable timeframe. As the administrator, it requires very little time from me to keep it running and get new team members trained, which is fantastic. Most importantly - it's easy for team members to track their time, and the chrome extension means they don't even have to open a new tab to start/end a tracking session. Also, it was easy to deploy and the cost is low.

Amazing free tool for time tracking and team management
Before choosing Clockify we tested various competitors. Since Clockify provided an equal set of features and functionalities, but is free, it suited us very well (as a startup with limited resources). That said, we're considering the paid plan, given it is very affordable, adds more features, and supports the maintenance and further development of Clockify. Given it's a free tool there's nothing to complain about - the feature set is very rich Just worth pointing out Clockify is a manual time tracking tool (different to other tools that track our usage in the background).

Great way to track time and be more productive
It is very simple and quick to use, I don't have to go through endless menus to just track my time. I now can track my time down to 5 minute intervals, and when managing a full kitchen it is integral to know where your time goes. At first, using Clockify is a chore - remembering to use it is hard, until it becomes second nature and you start appreciating the resolution to which you can track your time. Clockify helped me keep track of all the time I spend on management duties. It helps me see how much of my time goes towards managing the kitchen, and how much goes towards managing people. Working in a large group, a lot of my time was spent micromanaging people who should have been left to their own devices, and Clockify helped me see that. I am now much more in control of my own time, and that makes me more efficient.

Great Free Tool for Tracking Time
Overall I've been loving my experience with Clockify. It's simple yet versatile and serves my needs. I generally charge my clients a flat fee per project or per month. One day I realized tracking the time spent per client or project might be a good idea. Then, I can see if the rate seems fair, or if certain tasks are taking longer than seems reasonable. I like being able start a timer in one tab of my browser that runs in the background while I work. I also like having the option to manually add time worked if I was not running the timer. Being able to pause the timer to take a break and then resume the timer on the same task is very convenient. Clockify will keep track of the total time worked. If you need to, you can drill down to see the start and stop times for each session. The reporting feature lets you choose from several common time intervals (this week, past two weeks, last month, etc.); but they also give you the flexibility to choose a custom range from a specific date to a specific date.

Fills the gap where project management apps fall short
Clockify is lightweight and easy to use. You can make it as robust as you'd like by adding tags, projects, and tasks, but you can also keep it super simple with just time tracking. You can easily choose to grant access to clients, use it as a solopreneur or expand to include a full team. I've tried several project management and freelance all-in-one solutions, and the ones that excel in most areas completely flop in timetracking, so i use Clockify to fill that gap, and then easily attach my timesheets or reports to invoices in other software.

Amazingly made tool
I have been using Clockify for a few months now. Starting a new job from home, I needed something to track every hour worked easily. The software is easy to use and it's very convenient to navigate through the different menus. There's infinite possibilities to track different clients, different types of tasks done, ... It's easy to export week hours and transfer it to whoever is concerned. All in all, my expectations weren't very high, but Clockify exceeded them genuinely.

Simple, Feature Rich, and Clean
We needed to track internal time comitted to a large multi-month project. This gave us the ability to easily have users log time, attach to specific portions of the project, and have easy month-end reporting. It was a very simple setup, easily integrate into a Teams page, and feature-rich with the reporting we wanted.

Absolutely brilliant!
I've been using this software for about a year now. I was previously on a freelance platform that offered an hourly option, but for various reasons I don't use it anymore. Most of my clients are fixed rate, but I have a few who prefer to pay by the hour. I didn't quite know what I was getting into with Clockify but I LOVE it! You can customize an hourly rate by project, categorize projects under larger projects, etc. The stats features are great, too. You can customize the timesheet you send to clients, and automatically save it as a pdf file which is great - PayPal will not accept Excel. Overall, I'm highly satisfied with Clockify. I recommend it to my other freelance colleagues, and will continue to do so. I'd recommend this to any freelancer out there who wants a reliable, quick and easy way to track time.

Seamless time tracking
Clockify is so easy to use and intuitive. The learning curve to master the platform is almost none. From the first time I used it, it's like you just know what to do with it. You can easily click on the time and update it if you forgot to start the clock when you started the task. You can manually input time or use the auto-tracker. You can put in the description of your task without hassle. I love it! It has saved me so much time when it comes to billing my hours because I can categorize tasks and color code them. The ability to run reports based on client, task, or category saves me a lot of time during billing because I am able to see how much time I spent on certain categories. For example, I charge a client X amount for consultancy hours and Y amount for training hours. So I have a consulting and a training category. Clockify allows me to run a different report for each so I can see how many hours of each category. The app has been really helpful in being able to track my time while out in the field. It's great!

Great Interface with an excellent mix of form and function!
What I really liked most about this software is that it allows you to either input the time once you're done with your task or just let it run so when you're done, you can just stop it and see how much time you spent on a task. Overall, clockify can still improve their interface but as of now, it's really excellent for me.

User-friendly Time Tracker
Clockify is user-friendly and very easy to navigate. I never experience any downtime within the past 2 years that I used it. The paid features are fabulous if you are managing a team. Timing and being able to scrub time entries as necessary is also simple. I am super satisfied with it's simplicity yet gives me an overview of the complexity of my team's agenda and tasks done. It gives me peace of mind that they are working on the project and how much time they spend on each project.

Conveniant time-tracking tool with powerful free-tier
Clockify allows me to keep a general log of my activities throughout the working day and help me bill and plan more realistically. Pros: Easy to use, both for new users and power-users (not very repetitive, simple manual entry options) Reliable; never had a clock go wrong or a session disappear. The free-tier doesn't omit essential tools, which was crucial in getting me on-board. Editing time-entries is easy, clear and efficient.

I've been using the free version for about 6 months now, and it's great!
After using Clockify, I can honestly say one of the benefits I've experienced is I've noticed trends in my own workflow that I wouldn't have noticed without a time tracker tool like Clockify. It's definitely a good choice for me for tracking my work times. The software is intuitive, the user interface is easy to understand and it has everything I need as a freelancer who needs to track hours for my employer. I send my employer a link to my 'Report' once and they can view it anytime. I also like that there is an option to start a timer for tracking, or to manually put in the times I've worked. I also especially liked how the software automatically groups items that have the same name (i.e. if I do work A at two separate times of the day, Clockify automatically groups them together). It helps make the UI look a lot cleaner and organized.

It's easy to use, and very convenient. Well, it's free, which is great. But, that would be worthless if it didn't do the job we needed. We use this for managing our team of 10 and it works great. I can create custom reports and group employees by type, location, project, etc. You would not expect this product to be supported since it's free, but they do, which is fantastic. Really good. First and foremost, it works. There have been no development bugs or situations that made me want to leave. As I mentioned, I have a few suggestions, but overall this is a TREMENDOUS value for the price.

Helped me fix working overtime
I work part-time as an Administrative Assistant and was working well over my weekly paid time. Clockify has helped me to fix that and track my working hours, and overtime, as well as track the amount of time that I spend on certain pending projects. I like the ability to categorize by project. This saves me so much time at the end of the week tracking the progress of my projects. It also helps me to visualize when it is time to wrap it up and move onto another pending project.

Great Time Tracking!
The Time tracking features are great, especially for businesses with 3 or more employees. Charts graphs overtime tracking, and tons more. It was just a 7-day trial, it was enough time for me to know it had too many features for me. Businesses that are larger and paying hourly will find this to be an essential time tracking tool. For companies that have projects and teams will find Clockify to be the best for them. I have recommended it to friends, small business owners, and they have found it to be perfect for their needs. It is worth a look and trial, you won't regret it.

You can have teams too for free, and unlimited projects for free. Set them to be billed or not, customize times and dates you worked or just set it on the go. It is awesome. I love it to say the least and I am glad I can contribute to others learning and getting it as well to try it out. You will be impressed even with the free version.

Although time logging is tedious, Clockify does a good job of mitigating that in an easy to use product.

The best intuitive tool for time tracking
The ease of use is unparalleled among other similar apps that I've used. The number of clicks to start, create, label, and stop an event are kept to a minimum which is great for a user who tracks many different activities each day. This app strikes the right balance between easy to use and highly configurable. I love the ability to set a bunch of different lables/categories up the first few uses and easily search and bookmark them for future use. Lots of the tasks that I am tracking fall into the same categories on a daily basis, so it's important to have these easily accessible when marking a task. Every time I switch tasks, I can easily end the current with one click and start the next one, name it, and categorize it in just 3 clicks. The reports are also very nice and clear, breaking down time usage in an easy to visualize format that makes spotting trends over weeks very easy.

Clockify has saved me money and made me money
Since I have multiple franchises that we service, being able to have the team clock in under each franchise for the time they spent for that area, and running the report to show the client how he was receiving his appointments (we do appointment setting call center services) at a ratio far better than what he expected was profitable to me, it also helped me with being able to bill the correct amount to each client with no disputes or questions. It helped me show the franchises how are appointments per time on project was higher than he had anticipated which encouraged more clients to contract us. I have referred fellow business owners that have remote workers to use Clockify it is easy to use and has a break down of almost everything I could think of.

Finally, a simple and easy-to-use time tracker
I've tried almost every time tracker out there, and Clockify is by far my favorite. It lets me set different workspaces and keep everything neatly organized without wasting time wondering what's what. I can easily create a project, add the tasks I need to complete, add a tag or note for the specific task I'm tracking, and start the timer. Even when the timer is running and it sits next to my working document, it never distracts me with intense colors or moving elements that I've found annoying in other apps. The best thing I love about it, though, is how easy I can filter through the reports. This is invaluable, especially when you want to keep an eye on how much something is taking you, so you know how much time to allocate for a similar task in the future. I use Clockify internally, so I don't use the team or client specific features, but it's all readily accessible so it's always there if and when I need to access those features. The other major pro for me is that it's not a software that forces you into an upgrade or limits the features you can use if you're on the free plan. That is something I value a lot as a marketer and user, so if my needs grow beyond using it for my own projects, I wouldn't think twice about supporting Clockify over other options. Clockify took away one of my biggest headaches: having a time-tracking tool that's not intrusive in any way but one that's flexible, simple, easy to navigate and - most importantly - get a sense of how much time you spend on a task every week.

Clockify is a game-changer
I love Clockify! I was struggling with keeping track of work time for each client, and HOW I spent that time. Now I can log the specific task, project, client, and time worked super easily. And then I can run reports at the end of the month for billing purposes. If a client wants to know my time breakdown, I've got a report for that! It's a wonderful free way to keep track of time and projects for the work I do for each of my several clients. I'd gotten advice from my peers that Clockify was great and you get tons of great features for free. Since starting to use Clockify, I won't switch. It's intuitive so I didn't have to spend a lot of unpaid time trying to learn yet another app.

I like that the time tracker is easy to use and supports many integrations through a Google Chrome browser extension.

We use many online tools to collaborate and plan. Clockify has supported 90% of them through the Chrome extension.

A game-changer for tracking remote work
There are two big pros to using Clockify as opposed to other apps. The first is that I can track on my phone--a few taps and I'm ready to get onto my work--but when doing my invoicing, I can pull the information up on my web browser and see the big picture. The second is being able to categorize my work by both client and project--I can then see later how much time I've spent on x or y, and figure out how to become more efficient or based on hours paid out, justify a software upgrade to save me time. Thanks, Clockify!

Best Time Tracking software
Overall I think it's the best option for time tracking for a freelancer like me and I use it daily to track my time with a timer and keep notes for the time interval and share the reports with my clients. I am a freelancer who works with various clients and I use Clockify to track how many hours I work for a particular client and bill them according to it. I can start/stop the timer and also add start and end time for my worked hours and write notes for the particular time interval. I can work with multiple clients with a different dashboard for each client and can tag the project name for the time I worked and also tag it as billable or non-billable. These features have helped me much as I can work for multiple clients with proper time management and tracking so that I can efficiently manage my workloads. Also, I use its chrome extension so that I can start/stop the timer from the extension itself and write notes for the time interval. Also, it allows me to generate reports summary, detailed, weekly, or with custom date interval and also allows to share the reports in different formats. It's easy to use with a good user interface and best time tracking software as I searched and switched from one to another until i found Clockify.

Integrates with technology effortlessly. This company is always upgrading and staying innovative. If you don't pay attention to detail, you could easily pass up this little diamond. This software has proven time and time again to work just as well as some of the big-name products out there. Works a little better in my own opinion. Timesheets, reports, the whole nine-man! Geesh! There is so much more to this software that I haven't even tapped into yet. One would be the Geographic logging in feature... Well, my overall experience would be that I'm totally satisfied and would purchase again if I had to. Give them a try. This software is definitely moving you into the digital age which is fantastic.

A simple yet great time tracker
I started using Clockify at the beginning of last year to start tracking time when working on development for a company we had a contract with. Once the contract was over, I kept on using Clockify, just because it is a great way to manage your time and make sure you stay on track (or at least track how much you didn't). I love that now I know what I used to spend my time on without even realizing and I could make corrections to make myself more productive. It is non-intrusive. The UI is clean and simple and it does not distract from its primary function - to track time. Don't get me wrong, there are many time tracking options available in Clockify, from actual costs to advanced reports and timesheets, but the basic UI is very easy to navigate and it does not make you go through hoops just to track your time.

Best time tracking app we've found
The simple interface makes it really quick and easy to track and record time. The reports are very useful and assist with costing out jobs at the end of each month, especially as you can assign hourly rates. Allows us to easily attribute time to projects, by client and also the ability to add bespoke tags is useful too. If a company needs to measure profitability, the option to log time as billable or not billable makes reporting this a dream. We haven't had to use customer support as we haven't experienced any long term issues. We're now able to identify ways in which to improve profitability for the company. Has increased the accuracy of time being tracked, as well as encouraging team members to track who were previously poor at doing so.

Best time tracking app out there
I most love how easy this app is able to integrate into my workflow. It literally only takes me a few clicks to switch gears to a different project. So when a customer calls up and I need to start tracking my time differently, I can switch my time to a new task (before I even know what the task is) and once the customer fills me in on the needs of the call, I can start to detail the clock that is still running, without interrupting anything. Overall, Clockify has helped streamline my small business. I no longer have to worry about keeping timestamps in my head while picking up the phone, or jotting a quick note down that I'll forget what it's in reference to later. Clockify has made me more efficient, and more accurate, two things that are wonderfully customer-centric.

Excellent for labor-based pricing
Clockify makes it really easy for me to time my labor on various projects. When pricing my goods for sale, the majority of the cost is in labor, so this is a huge help. You can set your hourly rate, have different timesheets for each project, and timing is as simple as a start/stop button. Great experience - it makes pricing my products a breeze. It's very easy/simple to use, but there are also tutorials if you need help. I would highly recommend Clockify.

Best app for tracking your time, it does what you need exactly
The ease of tracking time on multiple tasks and switching between them, whether I'm in front of my computer or on my phone. i also love that i can just start a timer without needing to fill in the required fields. Sometimes i just need to switch gears because a customer has called me, and i don't know what i'm going to be tracking exactly, the ability to fill it in on the fly after already starting the timer is a real winner. i have been able to increase my efficiency when multi-tasking tremendously. With the ability to add in a quick note an associated project, i am quickly doing what i should be, working.

Quickest, easiest way to track my project time
The top thing that i like about Clockify was how easy it was to get started. The second thing that i really enjoy was that it was easy to fix the early mistakes that i made in how i used it from the beginning. i was looking for something to easily track the time i spend on projects that were assigned to me. Most products I've tried take too much time to setup and too much time to maintain. Clockify hits the prefect balance between flexibility and setup/maintainability that it's something i can see myself using long term. At this point I've been using it for a month.

Wow, I cannot believe the amount of functionality is included in the free version
The UX is great, it's very easy to use, and is very feature-rich. I track my entire day, every day. The mobile app is fantastic as well.

Most Intuitive ans straight-forwarded time tracking app
As a Product Designer, I love the fact that I can use this software daily to track my activities and not feel that I'm wasting any time organizing or studying the software to learn how it works, it's a clean and very intuitive software that I'm pretty sure anyone can use regarding of his/her knowledge or experience with clocking software. Since I use clockify I've become more productive because I can analyze all my tracked activity with ease, in only a couple of minutes you can get a detailed overview (with a very complete filter system) of all the activity tracked in the last month. The most challenging thing about using Clockify is really building the habit to track everything you do; but the more you track, the more productive you become.

I'm so impressed with the amount of functionality offered in this FREE software! Prior to finding this software, I used a basic stopwatch to time myself while working, along with a spreadsheet to keep track of how much time I'd worked for each client.

Surprising Time Tracker for Individuals and Teams
Very clean and minimalistic look that makes time magement a breeze. You can have it working on a browser tab or download it as a desktop version and in seconds (really, in seconds) start recording how much time is spent on whatever your working. It's main focus is on multitasking, when you jump from project to project, and when knowing how much time you dedicated to all your work and chores. Now I understad why so many big companies are choosing Clockify for time management for individuals or teams. I had mu first time tracker in seconds (mainly after watching the intro video, very recomended so you don't waste time pushing buttons). In half a day I already had five different time trackers, acknowledging just how multitasking I can be. Give it a try, I started today just wanting to get back tracking time of whatever I could find.

EaThe prefect software for a starting business
I was looking for a way to track my billable time for clients. Clockify was the prefect solution. I love that I can have multiple projects running at the same time, and each one is individualized and kept separately. Its lovely piece of software for a starting business. Time keeping was a huge issue for me! I work on custom pieces of Athletic wear and changer per hour. However most of these projects are multi-day projects and require pauses along the way. It is great to have something that tracks the time for you! and not only that but also gives you an idea of your hourly cost which is a great way of avoiding unexpected surprises to the customers since your cost estimates are directly estimated. I use these estimates to let me customers know ahead of time if budget changes along the way.

Nice and easy timetracking software
Freelancers most likely are paid hourly so they need to count the hours. Even not freelancer may want to see how and where they spend their time. I used to use it when I was a freelancer and recommended to my current company. The free plan is kinda generous and better than the one in toggl, it has the "billable hour" feature for free where in toggl it is paid.

Love!
The best thing about Clockify is its extension. I love that thing. I can start a new task from one click of a button. Not only is it easy but it also integrates with my other platforms, like ASANA, Gmail, and Google Sheets. Overall, I am satisfied with the software. I can edit my start times if I forget to stop or start the clock and I can also edit the description and tags. It's a great platform for those who want to track their time and see where their time is being spent on.

So Easy To Use
My colleague recommended Clockify to me and I decided to give it a try. I thought that there would be a learning curve, but there wasn't! It was so intuitive and easy to understand that I just started using it and it has changed my world. I'm not making notes on paper or trying to remember what I did or when I changed projects. I keep the Clockify tab on my browser and every time I change projects I just go to the Clockify tab first, stop one project and start or restart the next. I used to hate tracking my time, now it's FUN! I really HATED tracking my time before Clockify and now I LOVE it! It's made me more efficient because I know, for sure, how much time I'm spending on each of my work projects. I'm considering using it for personal projects too!

Great for Clients who Want Hourly Breakdowns
It is straight forward and simple to navigate with lots of break downs of time and projects. I have a few clients who rather have hourly breakdowns vs whole project fees so this is a great way for me to track each thing inside a project I am doing for them. I can get in there quickly and calculate the hours for a speedy invoice. Having all the time logged grouped by a project is great especially like me who just has 1 or two clients and a few projects I have to track. It's fantastic for me and my business to handle my time tracking quickly and easily for clients who like hourly breakdowns of their project budget. I found the software and jumped straight into it with tracking hours for clients and their individual projects. The reports are nicely laid out and easy to read and navigate. Having the option to track billable vs non-billable hours is also a bonus. You can easily see where your time is going in a day, week, or even year.

Excellent and simple way to record time
I work on both customer support projects (answering questions, debugging, investigations, training) as well as development projects (my main role is in the R&D department). Clockify is extremely helpful for keeping track of all the little bits of time I spend on all these various projects. Before Clockify, the only way I could report my time (so it could be charged to the correct projects) was to look back through the email I had sent all week and guess how much time each effort took. Now I can just look at the Clockify report and report the actual hours spent on each! The reporting is not the whole benefit, though. If the recording were a hassle, I wouldn't use the tool - no matter how good the reporting. Fortunately, reporting time in Clockify is quick and easy. I can just enter text for the project, hit a button, and I'm off. If the project already exists, it's even easier - just press the "play" button next to the project. Altering time is easy too.

Clockify perfect matches my needs for tracking my work
The software is really ease to use and the browser extension helps tracking the workload without open too many browser/software windows. So in a glance I can add a project and track what I'm working on at the moment and when and I'm able to know from any device a report of my worksheet. I was looking for a simple and easy to use time tracker as using paper + pencil was no more a good option for me (too much time wasted with this method). After reading some reviews I started to use Clockify and since then (a bit less than an year) I'm satisfied of my choice. The software is really ease to use and it has a lot of features that can help to save precious time about time management. When I first started to using this software I didn't need some of the features available, but as trying them I've found how helpful they're; the newsletter is also helpful into keeping update on how to use this features and it gives also some nice working tips.

Clockify is a crucial tool for managing your business
I can't emphasize enough how crucial and how helpful Clockify is for running my business! As a self-employed independent contractor managing multiple clients, this software allows for easy and accurate time tracking and billing - all at no cost. I can track my time by the hour, with automatic calculations for rates, or add and edit items retroactively. This software also allows for clear reporting with varying filters and levels of detail, along with visual illustrations, helping me easily invoice clients and better manage my workflow along the way. Being an online-based platform, I can also use this software seamlessly anywhere - whether working on my desktop, or on-site with a client using the mobile app, or back and forth between the two as needed. For my needs, this software really doesn't have any cons. For someone managing multiple employees and varying project needs, this software might stand some room for improvement or become less cost effective. For me, however, there isn't a single issue - it's exactly what I need.

Decent Free Project Time Tracking Software
We currently use the free version of Clockify's time tracking software for projects. Very easy to use and has a Chrome Plug-in that you can install so you do not have to navigate to a webpage to start or stop tracking time spent on a project. Able to run different reports to understand time spent on projects. Able to set a billable rate for time spent on projects and then run a report to show what billable cost for time spent on a project is. Functions exactly as I need it to. I am a Corporate Recruiter for about 8 different companies all owned by one Owner. I use Clockify to track time spent on recruiting for all of our companies separately so that costs of my department are shared appropriately based upon use of recruiting services. Clockify allows me to track my time based upon what company I am doing tasks for and then produce a billable amount for each company at the end of the month.

Help keep track of your workload
I love that I can use Clockify on both my desktop and phone and that there is the option of manually entering your time or starting the timer while you work. The timer actually keeps me focused on the task and I don't get sidetracked with other projects. The reports that Clockify generates also allows me to show my boss which projects are taking most of my time and when. This will be especially important when we hire someone to take over my position. The new employee will have a better idea of what the workload will look like.

Easy to use
I like that I can use the webpage or the Chrome extension to keep track of the amount of time I work on different projects. It is easy to create projects and then keep track to see where I am spending my time. By using Clockify I can easily track my comp time and turn in something tangible instead of what I think. The interesting thing I have noticed is that I don't spend as much time on help tickets as I thought.

Hands down, the easiest time keeping platform, EVER!
I love how easy and uncomplicated Clockify has made it for me to simply keep track of my hours worked. I absolutely love how I can separate my projects and clients, while still keeping account how many hours I've spent. I brag about Clockify to all my co-workers and friends. I love the U.I. and organization. I speak so highly about the reports, which is my favorite feature.

Simple but powerful time tracking
Clockify has a super slick design with a very cleaned up user interface. I am using Clockify for my own business, since I would like to track time for my customers. The problem I ran into is only finding tailored solutions for project management tools (i.e. Jira, Pro-Tool, ...) to track time on special platform artifacts like tickets. But, I needed a generic solutions covering multiple clients, leaving me an option to enter billable hours, different rates for different clients and super easy start and stop. From all the years I am working, the true superb attribute of an awesome time tracking app is a ultra simplistic way to start and stop tracking. No one wants to spent time on this task.Clockify is providing me everything I would like to have in a time tracking application - this is why I love it!

Clockify is amazing
I love that I can track my time and have it separated by each client and projects. I'm not solving anything life changing.

A nice and easy way to track your activities
- Easy to use - You can use a nice number of features for free - Dashboard feature is nice and useful, showing you how many hours you have worked on each project, the total amount of money you have earned when they are billable, check your projects by week, month or year, etc. - It allows you to create tags for your projects, for better organization. - You can also create reports - Support includes tutorials, though it is a pretty intuitive tool - It allows you to share information with your clients - Allows you to manually edit the entries (time, date, tags, etc) - Has a feature to label and keep track of billable projects - Really complete tracker software for your projects. It has helped me keep track of my freelance projects and It has been incredibly useful. I have no need for any other tool to manage the time I spend on each project and the money I´ve been earning with each. It also helps me keep track of the freelance work that has already been paid and the things I still have to charge for. I totally recommend it.

So convenient
The software is so convenient to use. Even a transfer of location won't affect the timer. Having a mobile app is a plus factor! Overall, Clockify is a good software to use. I think it's a convenient platform to track tasks and hours, can be used as a reference for reports and really handy, as it has a mobile application.

Simple time tracking, both for productivity and timecards
I like how simple it is to enter a time entry and categorize everything. You can input your time based on start/stop, or enter the times manually. I'm able to track my time as a productivity tool, and I'm also able to track it for pay. The simplicity is its true brilliance.

Very good free time-tracker
When I started using Clockify I never had any experience in time-tracking software so I was a bit concerned. Anyway the simplicity of Clockify allowed me to start tracking the time I spent working very easily and with a straight-forward approach. Since I am working with web content, and there are multiple tabs constantly open in my browser, the Clockify page title which updates as time progresses was a very nice feature to have. I am overall satisfied with Clockify and look forward to use it even more. Straightforward and rapid signup process. Extremely easy to use. Possibility to either track how long it takes to complete a task in real-time or manually add an interval of time. Each task can be marked as billable and can be assigned a tag to keep everything organized. Bulk edit of tasks is a very useful feature that allows the user to edit multiple task at the same time. The Dashboard and Reports sections seem useful too, but I did't use them much so I can't say exactly. There is the app for iOS.

Accuracy In timing
When timing tasks, it gives accuracy even when you need to take a break you just stop the time tracker and resume when you get back. You also get a break down of the work that you have done during that time or day. You get value for your money when an employee is logged on because you can tell when they are working and when they are not.

Easy to use and understand
I use Clockify to track my work hours for my freelance graphic design company. This helps me so much because instead of "guesstimating" how long everything really took to complete, I can have the hour by hour work process documented for myself and my clients. It is free and simple to use, I don't see any downside to it! I have used this software for a little over a year and have not had any issues with it.

Amazing Time Management For ANY Price
Clockify is a quick, easy and efficient way to track my times for billing my customers that lets me record my time and get on with my life. If you just need straight forward, project or task based time management, for free, this does the trick! SO many features, expertly designed and presented, for free? Their claim is totally true, it really is free, for however many users you have, and their features put some of the most expensive time tracking apps out there to shame. The free version has everything you need to get the job done, and if you need even more they do offer paid plans that expand on advanced features. That said, I've always found the free version to be plenty. They have applications for all mobile devices and quick web access that makes it easy to enter your times and keep moving.

Clockify is a great tool that makes life easier
Clockify helps me not only keep track of my time, but also better manage it as well. Sometimes when I'm working on something, Clockify allows me to recognize that I've been working on something for a little longer than the time I wanted to allot. This helps me understand when perhaps I'm spinning my wheels or that next time I should set more time aside. Very useful information! I can keep track of my time sheets in detail with ease, for free! Clockify is very malleable, meaning there's always a simple way to fix up your time sheet. You aren't locked down to a time entry and you can even change the start time for the stop watch if you forget to set it!

So convenient
I love the fact that I no longer need to count my hours! that app saved my life, it's so easy now to log in and out, I can also add notes of what sort of time I'm logging, like time for meetings, time for collecting artwork for printing output and actual time for artworking or designing. At the end, it gives me a report of the whole project with how much money I've made. All projects are colour coded which is great, It's very easy to use. It is really good for me, and the app is on the phone too, great for keeping track of project time.

Great for Productivity
I truly enjoy how I can log in through my Google account, instead of having to remember another password. I also love how there is a time tracker that is down to the second on how much time I have spent on each task or project.

This really helps to increase my productivity and take advantage of my time constructs.

Fit my needs exactly
I manage quickbooks for our family-run business. But I'm also a work-at-home-mom and have to fit in my hours whenever I get the opportunity. Clockify made it really easy to sign in, start my clock, and get an hour's worth of work here and there, without having to use an overly complicated or fancy time-tracking software. I also homeschool and wanted to track how much time we spend on our school activities, so I like that I can categorize what I'm doing before I start working, and can keep those records on hand, for when I might need them. Before using Clockify, I was trying to keep track of my hours on a piece of paper that kept getting misplaced. Now, I have access to how much time I've been working and can get compensated properly.

Best Time Tracking Software
Clockify is the fabulous software for time tracking and organize our time in an effective way. there are some features that I really like in this platform are: 1) It is very simple to use because of its user-friendly design. 2) Clockify has a chrome extension too so that I can easily track my time for my different work by just a single click. 3) I can distribute the workload equally to the employer's head. Overall I want to conclude that this platform is awesome for increase your productivity and measure time taken by multiple projects and you can improve your time management, once you are developing a habit to use it daily. In free version, they are providing all features and that is big thing because there are many time tracking software that takes some fees or charges. so according to me, you should have to use this platform once in your life.

Close to perfect!
Clockify changed the mode of time tracking, earlier our teams were using Excel sheets to keep the track of login/logout time but now time tracking is more streamlined, efficient and error-free. The best thing about this solution is that it is intuitive, all the feature are simple and easy to comprehend. Also, summary reports can be exported in Excel format which helps in analyzing the data easily. Clockify never disappoints us and it certainly has improved our team's productivity.

Simple, powerful, and FREE
I have never used an app for tracking time before, but it was so easy to get started with Clockify. The interface is very simple and straightforward. Often simple and easy means a lack of features and flexibility, but not in this case. Time can be categorized by project and tag in addition to space to detail exactly what you're working on (if needed). The reports are easy to find, customize, and interpret too. As a nonprofit leader, I needed a quick and easy way to track my time in different categories (as required by some grants). Funds are always tight for nonprofits, so I also needed an affordable solution. Clockify perfectly fits the bill!

Tried 3 time tracking apps, Clockify was the best
I like the simplicity of it. It's easy for use for a first time time tracker. What I really like is that it's easy to manually enter times for a task instead of pressing the play button to track time, and you can press the play button but later manually edit the times very easily. I'm accurately tracking my time on a 20 hour/week work from home job. I'm also tracking categories of work, like onboarding, admin, fundraising, etc. in order to justify hiring another employee.

Sanity for freelancers
I love that I have the ability to divide my clients into different projects and to see exactly which clients are consuming most of my time for the day/week/month. It is so easy to us and a godsend for freelancers! I am solving the problem of not keeping accurate time for my clients. It's so easy to just respond to that quick text message or shoot that quick email and not record the time. With the Clockify app, though, I can easily record my billable activity from my phone. Send the email or text or have the conversation and then go turn the clock off and get on with other work. Brilliant and super handy!

Ease of use, desktop app, and quick online timesheet for billing made this a game changer in my daily routine. Breaking out by client and projects makes invoicing a breeze.

It was complicated and timely. The app has made tracking a breeze and I'm much more confident I'm billing all my hours each month.

Great solution for great value
The intuitiveness of the software really shines, along with its well designed and minimum UI, making Clockify a pleasure to use. The fact that it is free for their basic tier is brilliant, and lets you get a great feel for the product before upgrading to the software completely. Analytics/Reports has been well thought through and even allows you to see a high level view on what your team is actively working on for your set time frame. We've now got a very accurate overview of how much time, money and manpower we are putting into each product. This allows us to better estimate how much future projects will cost us, and therefore how much we need to bill the client. This has also improved client relationships as they can see how much time is being spent.

Clockify for needlework
I am an avid needleworker and folks are always asking me how long it took to stitch something. I usually just respond, " it doesn't matter,". But I recently started a large project and wanted to keep track of my time. Clockify fits the bill perfectly. I have added tasks to separate parts of the sampler and can see how many hours I spend on each section. When I finish I will be able to print out a summary and keep it with the project info. I find it very easy to use and have recommended it on several needlework sites. I am not a business, but Clockify a wonderful way to keep track of my hobby time.

Best $10 ever!
The multiple applications (website, phone apps) help staff more easily stay up on time entries. Also having the ability to setup weekly reminders should someone not log hours that meets the threshold really helps timely data entry. Even having different ways to enter time (tracker versus timesheet) has really helped adoption of the application. Allowing staff to enter as much or as little detail on their time entries has again added on another layer of end user adoption. Being able to "group" time entries based on projects has been a LIFE SAVER when it comes to reporting for grants or payroll. Clockify was so simple to implement and overall received a fairly quick buy in from the whole team. We write a number of grants each year for financial support and Clockify reports has saved so much time for our grant writer (whether it be based on a person or a project). And when we need to update the Accountant with vacation hours used in the past month, we no longer have to pull together multiple spreadsheets (we currently have 18 staff using Clockify). From an administrator standpoint, it was fairly easy to build out and has been pretty simple to manage once we were up and running. I tell everyone who needs a simple, straightforward time card system to use Clockify!

Great app for tracking your time
I LOVE the time tracker feature - I'm not super savvy with a lot of new softwares but I was able to immediately log in and start using the one feature I was in most need of. As someone who is self-employed and occasionally works for others, I was in desperate need of a simple way to track where my time was going every day and to help show a client what exactly I was doing for them and how long I was working. I'm not a huge fan of a lot of bells and whistles, so the simple time tracker is all I use and has been incredibly helpful in tracking my productivity and ending the day knowing what I did instead of wondering where the time has gone.

Painless billing and time tracking
I like being able to click "Start". It's a small thing, but it helps me focus on the task at hand. With a hand-written time sheet, I have to put down all the information at the beginning, or else I forget or get distracted. I've worked at places where tracking hours accurately was a nightmare. Everything was on spreadsheets entered in and tallied manually at all places. So much wasted time. Clockify streamlines billing and makes time tracking painless.

The best solution for tracking your valuable time
So, firstly, Clockify being free is one of its greatest strengths. I have been using it for a few weeks now and have all the features I could possibly need. Kudos to the Clockify team for putting up this tool that is actually useful as a free software, and not an advertisement for its paid version. Now, listing its pros: 1. The UI is clean and nice. Its distraction free and I love the color combination. 2. The Dashboard contains a lot of relevant and useful information. 3. You can export your reports to various formats (pdf, csv) so that's a big plus. The business problem was that we did not know how much time our projects were taking up and who was doing what work in detail. Clockify has solved this!

Great time tracker for small businesses!
There are many things I love about clockify! But, being a project manager in a small business the best thing was unlimited users for free! We have a lot of contractors and to have them be able to track time under our business anywhere for free is pretty awesome! Some projects we will have 3-7 people or more so it's fantastic that we don't need to pay for extra users every time we have a big project. I also enjoy the fact that you can assign a task to each user as a free option as well. There isn't a lot of limitations with Clockify's free option which was something that I kept running into with other time tracking software. My overall experience with Clockify has been great! I'm with a start-up small business and this was a perfect system to get our whole team time tracking! We have been using clockify since April and already start seeing results of estimates going over and catching when we've been going over hours in different departments. This also is a tool for our hourly tracking employees to help get more accurate results. Overall this has helped with tracking how we are doing as a company and helping us see how many billable hours we bring in. Thank you for such an awesome system!

Clocking in has never been easier
This software is so convenient and easy to use! The look is sleek and trendy, and the features are simple enough for all employees to understand. This is not only the best software I have found (upon hours of research), but it's FREE! Our business went from tracking hours on a notepad to this incredible program. What a tremendous difference it has made! It's free AND it allows us to clock in and clock out for specific hours/days instead of the traditional timer. Most of the other programs we considered are a pay-by-user. Also, the other programs we considered only had options to start a timer or fix time for that day. However, Clockify allows us to enter time manually for weeks previous, days in advance, etc. We have found that the reports are customizable on Clockify where other programs did not allow us to customize dates.

We use this software to track time for each and every task we do. If you miss your time tracking, you can easily track the time for your missed dates. Can view the time sheets every week, which gives us the summary of our working hours. We can easily describe tasks for each and every time we track the time. We use this product to track how many working hours our team completes per week. Reviewing this our management can have a idea what sort of tasks takes how much time to complete. Depending on it we we categorize future tasks.

The tool for professional freelancers
This is a wonderful tool that lets me track my time allocation per project, observe dashboards and reports about the time and calculate my invoice automatically. On top of that I can just print the timesheet and attach it to my invoices so that my clients have clear vision on what I have worked on. This is the best tool I have used and... it is completely free. The customer support was relatively fast via email and very helpful.

Finally an Intuitive Online Time Logger
I like that it is available to me online and can use it wherever I am. I was using QuickBooks' timer and I could only use it if I was at the computer where the program is installed.

This piece of software is simplicity in itself. Not only that, it is accurate and reliable. And as a time-keeping piece of software it is son non-demanding of the user's time - log in, choose a client, describe the activity and press start. Then press finish when you are finished. It really couldn't be easier. There are also various reports one can run that provide not only a comprehensive overview, but more than you need - that having been said, the "more than you need" will keep even the most devoted "clipboard and pen" person happy.

Clockify is a great free tracker
I have used Clockify for close to two years and I have yet to find a time tracker that is as functional and straightforward. Other apps have more modern designs, but at the expense of usability. The basics of any time tracking app is, of course, tracking time. Reports are also very helpful, along with tasks for a project. Clockify is the one app I've found that is free for all those features. It's well designed and thought out. Every feature you need is within quick access and simple to find. Clockify has a great free level, and upgrade price for more advanced features is very reasonable. It also is easy to use. Since I don't have a lot of time as a small business owner, I need to be able to jump in and use the program right away without downtime. No other app I've found has as easy an onramp as Clockify.

With Clockify, I really get to tag bits of my time into various baskets.

Nice way to keep track on your time
Clockify has a really neat interface, and once completely configured it allows quick and easy operation. On the main screen, you can simply hit the start button on the project you're working on and hit again whenever you stop and it will add directly a new entry on the log of that project. That's pretty quick when you need just to focus on the work. Besides this, on this screen you can also select each entry and decide if it will be billable to the customer or not by just hitting another button. A really useful feature on Clockify is that you can set by default a billing price for your time, but also you're able to set a specific price per project, so when you set billable time to any project, it will apply the specific price in case it is set or the default one in the other case. The dashboard section is also quite nice, but less useful, but anyway it shows some interesting info such as total time worked, or total earnings, most active projects and so on. Then maybe the most interesting feature are the reports since are the ones that allows you to collect all the generated data. They are really flexible and allows a wide variety of different results by using the filters and the data are really well presented using some charts and tables. And to finish, a nice feature is the ability of have shared projects with more people, this way you can log the time of the whole team and being able to decide if the time is billable or not, allows you some interesting posibilities.

Simple way to track your time
We use Clockify to track time for our entire development process. The developers track time for each of their tasks individually, which makes it easy to see which features cost the most. Clockify changed the way we work and has increased productivity mainly because we now know which tasks we spent too much time on so we can avoid such pitfalls in the future. It is the simplest way to track your time. It lets us track all of the time we spend on billable projects and it gives us the price we should bill the clients for our work. This software literally removed all guesstimation which was happening when people would not properly track their time.

Overall it has helped improve transparency across the team, resource allocation and importantly, using it doesn't impact on productivity either... it's fitted into our workflow pretty seamlessly. Clockify has really improved the performance of my team, and the way in which we can review and assess the tasks, projects and clients that are taking too much of our time has led to significant efficiency improvement. Like other well-regarded brands, the best statement I can make is "it just works"... and is now an essential part of our workflow.

Free product that is better than other paid softwares
I love that it is free and has better functionality than other softwares that I've tried and I had to pay for. I do part-time contract-based consulting on the side (I am a stay at home mom otherwise), and so I can't afford to pay for a software since it would be cost prohibitive. This has all the features I need to invoice my clients at the end of the month without being overly complicated. I also love the desktop "application" that goes along with the software and updates my timesheet instantly. The interface is also way better than other paid softwares.

Great alternative to expensive competition
For now, I'm liking the free version. It does exactly what I need it to do. Track time and provide basic reporting.

Works. Simple, easy to use, and does what it needs to do. A lot of trackers have too many features and it's not easy to use the basics. This gets it right by staying out of your way. The key point for a time tracker is to stay out of your way, and be reliable. This does both of those things.

The Most Functional Time Tracker
As a graphic designer, it is important for me to provide my clients with the accurate amount of work that I did, broken down into tasks and projects so that they are able to see what they are paying for. With Clockify this has become less of a burden for me and allows me to invest more of my time into what I do best rather than paperwork or counting hours. Simplicity vs functionality is a dilemma in modern softwares, one that Clockify excel in solving. The simple to use time tracker with the functionality of high end time trackers and a very reasonable price tag is what sold it for me. The ability to generate a full report, especially in format that is interactive in terms of date ranges, is a God sent feature that saved me the time from creating multiple reports. The organizational elements such as projects, clients, and workspaces allowed for a clean user experience where nothing is cluttered.

Clockify has been a revelation to running my start-up
I run a small start-up and freelance, which means a lot of juggling my own time and competing deadlines. When you're faced with endless to-do lists and different clients it's difficult to know what to do first, or if you're really spending the right amount of time on things. Using Clockify has allowed me to make sure I'm actually spending the time I say I will on a project, and let's me highlight what I've been working on, so I can adjust my priorities if I need too. It's also better shown me how much time I've spent on paid projects, so I can better price my services and increase my profits. The ease of use of Clockify is possibly the best bit about it - the Chrome extension is a godsend. It's simple to use and has good integrations with other software like the Google Suite and email. Unlike other paid versions of this kind of stuff, it also has a really decent free version so you really get time to work out if this is the right software for you, rather than just jumping in at the deep in.

It also doubles as a good way to gauge how long you have been doing a specific task. i find it helps keep me on task, and helps me to recognize when I'm multitasking when I'd rather be focusing on one task. Though tracking your time is difficult at first, sort've like a new excersize regimen, eventually the brain becomes accustomed and it is super easy to do. I'd recommend this service to anyone.

It's really easy to use, just click and get on with it. Business efficiencies have doubled in one week. i hadn't realised how much more is possible when you know you are against the clock. It's motivating to see how much paid work we have done versus admin. It really helps to show up the time you spend on admin, so that this can really be minimised.

Found my clock-mate
Easy to use, friendly, and with more features than the competitors!" It helps to track all my work hours, non-billable hours, so i can analyze in which tasks I'm being productive or not.

Easy time management
Clockify is a splendid time management tool, allowing you to track your time efficiently either by starting the clock, watching some actions and automating it or manual entries. Right on the initial screen you can create a Project, mark as billable or not, add tags, select a specific client and start your tracking on that task. You can use the Dashboard to see the time you've spent on each Project filtering by time period, billability and if you worked alone or with your team. You can also see the most tracked activities and the top Project you worked on. In the Reports tab you can filter by almost all information on your tracking, export to various formats, print and share your reports. You can do A LOT of customizations in your Projects and in your Team configurations, manage your Workspace, tags and clients and set limitations to some roles on the Team. All of this on the FREE VERSION!!! It's awesome that a marvelous software has so many free resources! You has three paid plan options that allow you to: Round time, limit what Projects the user can see, set required fields on time entries, lock changes in entries, update your lock date, hide pages from regular users, cost analysis, time approval, create alerts, manage accounts, authentication and custom fields. It has a simple and clean interface where you can find ANYTHING with ease and there's a Help tab with Documentation, Tutorials and Support. Clockify changed my way of work for better! Almost everywhere you will see a "Start timer" button. It is so easy to use that you don't even notice. Capability of connect with your APIs and use Webhooks from the start. Clear interface allowing you to access any features with few clicks. Apps for Desktop, Android, iOS and browser app. It watch your use of some apps (if you allow it) so it can automate your entries. Idle time function which will trigger if you get afk.

Great project/client tracking tool
They have a lot of free features and for a small upgrade fee can unlock even more. Now that i use Clockify, i can really see how much each time each client and project is taking and i can be more effective in my pricing.

The best app to track time and extra features that it offers are excellent
The ease of use, the app is very easy to use and can be operated easily. The fact that it shows the cost of hours which no other app supports. The extension it provided is cool and makes work easier. It was great so far the features are quite good as compared to other similar apps.
— Anmol S.
★★★★★
Great free time tracker
The free version is great. It allows us to have each employee track their own time and assign that time to specific tasks and projects. The Chrome extension is a fantastic idea.
— Joshua K.
★★★★★
One of the best time tracking solution out there
I was in search of an easy to use time tracking solution, being a project manager it is quite critical to know where my team spends most of their time and analyze this data to drive efficiencies and make better decisions in general. Clockify wins in many aspects here, I will list them out below. 1) Easy to use - it is easily accessible using a web browser and mobile, 2) Flexible - one can track time using the timer or chose to update it at the end of the day, also allows editing. 3) Fantastic individual & Admin dashboards. 4) Project-specific filtering. 5) Fantastic reporting capabilities. Excel based time tracking required a lot of manual work and quite honestly it was quite ancient, we wanted an easy to use interface available to all, accessible anywhere any time! Clockify was that tool.
— Boaz K.
★★★★★
Great product, great direction
The application package is reliable and ultimately extremely easy to use with the desktop applications and browser extensions tying right into things like Trello, Sentry, or Chrome itself. In addition, the integration with teams is a very nice touch. Our experience has been overall very positive. Clockify has helped us to identify wasted time and inefficiency which has actually helped our technology department reorganize some processing, same money and time, and ultimately get significantly ahead of our product launch schedule.
— Jason O.
★★★★★
The best free time tracker
Tracking per client and per project with options for tagging, teams, report in PDF and CSV. The free version is better and more intuitive than most paid solutions. What i like the most are plugins and extensions for Chrome and Opera and for Gmail, so that you can start tracking time right from gmail. I've been using Clockify for 9 months for tracking time on my freelancing projects.
— Iva N.
★★★★★
A great time tracking software at a great price! (hint: it's free!)
This software does an excellent job at tracking my time between various projects and clients. Clients for PC, Mac, Linux as well as Android/iOS and Chrome extensions means that you can easily track your time between devices. All good. i tried 4-5 competing products but Clockify won in my books.
— Doros A.
★★★★★
A great time-tracking tool
Time tracking works just great, with very nice reporting tools, and a plugin binding to most sites to easily add new entries. i was having a hard time trying to replace Meistertask's time tracking, but switching to Trello + Clockify was a great improvement overall.
— Lorenzo P.
★★★★★
Very useful in my limited experience
I wanted a simple, free way to track hours spent on projects, to allow me to complete my timesheet and bill multiple clients accurately. i tried a couple of solutions, but this one stuck. The support is very good, with prompt responses, and requested features added! i don't use Clockify in a team, so it's just me. But i track my hours so i can complete my timesheet, and it works very well.
— Matthew P.
★★★★★
Super simple daily use time tracker
Stopwatch function to just press start, type what it's about and hit stop when you're done. It's so much simpler than hacking hours into any jira, SAP, dynamics, or OmniTracker - i just copy the extract over once a week, saves me hours every month on admin overhead!" saves lots of time, shows me where i use too much and what the efforts are.
— Alexander B.
★★★★★
Clockify helps my work projects
Since i do freelance projects and sometimes charge by the hour, i use Clockify to track my time. i love how you can organize what you're working on by using tags, and categories. It really, simply just helps me track my time and i appreciate that.
— Ebony T.
★★★★★
Fantastic product, and it's free
The possibility to add very quickly the different tasks. i start to use Clockify because the time tracker of the company where i work is very slow. With Clockify i can export the data (already grouped for project) and send the info to the company time tracker. Now my job is also tracked more precisely than before.
— Nicola B.
★★★★★
Full-featured timeclock system
Clockify is easy and intuitive to use (for the most part), and the browser plugin makes it so you don't have to keep a tab open with the Clockify website. Clockify is a reliable and easy to use timeclock system.
— Eric R.
★★★★★
Great app to track time
Clean, organized, intuitive, and powerful UI, with all the crucial elements visible and very easy to find. A lot of functionalities, mainly those related to analytics like dashboard, reports, and timesheet, everything for free. They seem to be really concerned about your data privacy, which is a great plus. Exporting my tracked time is a great advantage too because I don't want to be stocked at one platform.
— Eric R.

A great help keeping track of time for clients
I like how easy it is to track time while working on the computer. I can enter time manually or set the timer on and turn it off when done. Easy to use. Reports are great. I can print for a single client and include it with my invoice to them. I am happy with the product. Easy to use.
— Susan H.
★★★★★
Great fully featured time-tracking software
Even the free version includes enough features to be a professional time-tracking solution. This works for generating client invoices and having multiple projects and tasks across clients. Great for managing multiple small businesses. I can now track my time and invoice my clients with minimal hassle. I can also track my time across my business to start to implement cost accounting.

Simple to use, full featured time tracker
Clockify has everything i need for tracking time. i use it as an individual rather than part of a team, but from what i have seen it serves teams very well too. It's easy to use and leaves me wanting nothing in terms of features.
— Shawn M.
★★★★★
Clockify helps me track my team
I like that it is web-based and very easy to use. i can track exact hours for each employee and project to see where inefficiencies are and see how much time is actually spent on different projects to provide better estimates for new customers. This software resolves the time tracking issues that I've had in the past when it was just me. i would find myself putting way more time on one project than the client paid for, which put other projects on the backburner. i needed a way to monitor and control this so i can spend the right amount of time on each client project.
— Ashley S.
★★★★★
Great time saving tool
I am using Clockify as a way of recording time spent on projects to be able to report timings to the PM. One of Clockify's best tools is the play button - which yes is featured in some competitor products - but Clockify allow you to override the time easily if you need to. The other fantastic thing about Clockify is the user experience. Everything is logical to figure out without watching a lengthy tutorial first - although there are great videos available if you get stuck.
— Erika S.
★★★★★
The perfect time tracker
This is a very easy piece of software to get straight into and use - it's immediately useful. As a freelancer and consultant, i work on multiple projects at any point in time. This application enables me to manage my time and to invoice accordingly.

★★★★★
Useful, functional, competitive price
I like Clockify because It is really made to help people track the time. It have a functions that is really needed free of charge (They have a very competitive paid plan as well). For solo users it allows to add clients, projects, tags and workspaces. In addition, For teams they provide a very storng permissions on workspace level. all these are in a cheapest price between all alternative services.
— Mueen M.
★★★★★
A Timer You'll Run Everyday
For the last few years of using Clockify, I realized one thing... there's no other time tracker on the web that I'd use. It's really simple to use, responsive, a surprising uptime, and a nice minimalist interface that looks clean and informative at the same time. I use it for several clients especially because you can easily send them a report when needed, sort time clocked for EACH of the clients in your database PLUS, you can even change the rate for each client. Overall, a really impressive web time tracker that any business or freelancer should use.
— Ellen Marie D.
★★★★★
Multiple clients and projects
This tool is great for managing multiple clients and projects. You can switch in and out super easy and does not slow down other functionality (as i have experienced with other applications). Very good. Easy to navigate. Support respond really quickly.
— Hannah G.
★★★★★
Great task management software
I love how simple it is to use and setup. i also like the mobile app. i can track my progress on the go or setting at a computer. i love it and it is simple for anyone to use. i am a programmer and i created something similar to Clockify for my workplace. i did not have the time to update and add functionality to the application. So i went out and looked to find a piece of software that could log and keep track on our projects. Clockify fills that gap and i am very happy and excited about this program.

★★★★★
Easiest time tracker I've found
Clockify allows me to create workspaces, clients, projects, and more. It allows me to break down my time tracking in the ways that are most useful to me, including creating projects and assigning tasks. i can then just click a project, click a task, and click to start tracking. It's simple, easy, and intuitive. I've never had a single problem with Clockify, compared to other software I've tried that made things way too complicated. i love Clockify. It's easy to use, keeps time tracking simple and sensible, and doesn't offer me a lot of extra stuff that i don't want. It doesn't pressure me to buy anything, and it doesn't have the most useful features locked behind the paywall.
— Wendy M.
★★★★★
Very affordable and convenient to use
Clockify has never disappointed us. Therefore, I have nothing against it. It is ridiculous. The support team is world-class and the experience with Clockify is fantastic. Clockify is available on Windows, Android and iOS, which makes it very flexible and convenient to use. We like tracking projects and employees' attendance because it is efficient and affordable.

★★★★★
Simple and great
Simple, great user interface, works with our company's payroll system (it's compatible), and great support. Good. Initially we had issues with the timesheets so we had our workers use the time tracker. Clockify's great customer support helped immensely with the problems the timesheet function originally had and they responded fast each time and have managed to fix all the issues and made it a great usable feature. i personally am using the timesheet and only use the Time Tracker interface to type notes for tasks and jobs.

Great time tracking app with a few rough edges
It's pretty full featured. You can categorize actions by projects, tasks, whether or not they're billable, tags, etc. And the interface is clean and easy to use.

Very easy to use and get into the habit of!
I find Clockify easy to use and it integrates seamlessly into my daily tasks. I've used it for about a year and a half and the ability to look back through my data offers me some really nice insights for things like estimating task length and quoting for jobs.
— Simon B.
★★★★★
Nice time tracker, with a lot of potential
Clockify has all the basic time tracking features you'd expect from a typical web tracking app. The interface is nice, clean, and easy to get around. Reports are useful and robust, and i can find anything i want using filters. Plus, Clockify is actually free and i can have as many users as i want
— Ethel R.
Clockify is the quick solution I needed.
Definitely beats shared Excel files!!!
— Sonia Heimann
I love Clockify!
I have and will continue to recommend you to my friends and colleagues in lieu of Toggl. Your free vs paid features make much more sense than theirs!
Please don't ever change that like Toggl did some time back, putting some of their core functionality behind a paywall. Keeping yours free is your edge in the market as well as your number-one lead capture!
— Joe Ammel, Owner at YourContentEditor
I just want to tell you that I'm so happy with what you guys have created. Clockify is SO FREAKIN' amazing –
I have literally used 10 other time tracking softwares (paid and free) and they are all complete trash compared to the user-friendly and great application Clockify
. No sarcasm boys and girls, it's awesome.
— Peter  Struyf
One of the best free (!) timesheet systems around,
definitely worth the attention

I use Clockify to monitor exactly how I spend my time whilst working during any given day.
I find it useful to know how long I'm spending on mixing and mastering projects so I can look at ways to improve my efficiency but also check that I'm charging the right price and not working for less than minimum wage by the time the project is complete.
By keeping the tasks the same for every project, I can track and calculate my time spent versus project cost to see if I'm taking too long or possibly need to charge more or up my rates. I find this sort of information useful so I can look at areas to improve and where It might make more sense to outsource or get some training.

I just recently moved my team's time tracking to Clockify.
Just within the last couple of months it's already saved me hours of time, with the ability to track activity and run reports.
Until this point, we had an internal, organized Google Spreadsheet system which was working but was lacking admin automation. (I was manually copying and pasting each team member's hours to calculate each project's bottom line, etc.) With Clockify I can see a day/week/month/manual view per team member or client. It's a game changer!! While I don't love the existing UI, the functionality is adding so much value.
— Chavi Rokach, CEO CoreWeb.Co
First of all thanks for making such an intuitive time tracking available for free!
I love the features you have there

Simple yet powerful.
It's simple to record, log, and organize hours, and easy to edit the timings if you accidentally leave it running. The dashboard is a big help in terms of visualizing the data.

Been giving your product a whirl for the past week and really loving it.
I've tried Toggl and few others, and yours is by far the simplest and most effective one
I've come across (and can't believe you provide it for free!). i love the simple dashboard, and the projects and tagging system works great.
— Jason Ashdown, Network N
You people are awesome! Thank you thank you thank you!
Is there a catch here somewhere?
Lol. I mean, we will probably upgrade to the basic level soon, but am I missing something? This is just so freakin awesome I was going to have to build this in an API based spreadsheet and you just saved me a week. I will tell everyone I know that can use a product like this about this. I'll post on FB too. Thank you!.
— Steven Mason, Lead Systems Integrator
Very simple and generous features.
Simplicity at its best
. Easy logging of timing. Showing the timer in tab title is something which gives you quick information of the progress all the time. Reporting is very easy to handle as they already have some predefined time-slots which is most common to be used.

I really enjoy your product.

Thanks for this time/life saver

— Tony Sargeant
Thanks for your great product!
It provides all the basic functionalites over a simplistic interface.
— Pouria Khakpour
Congrats on the great platform that you have built. We have been looking at a replacement of our current time tracker - Office Time. i have stumbled on Clockify rather incidentally, after looking into Zoho Projects, Bitrix 24 and TSheets.
I must say, the features and pricing of Clockify far exceed the other platforms. They are just too difficult to understand and start using.
Clockify seems very convenient and very much like Office Time with the added benefits of cloud sync and much better filtering of jobs.
— Nikolay Dimitrov, Chromeye
I'd like to say i appreciate your service. Clockify is very beautiful and smooth to operate,
I'm actually surprised such clean service is actually free.
— Daniel Candelario, JPC IT Solutions
By far the best priced and easy to use option available
. As my business grows I have the option to upgrade with more features.
— Diane Link, Owner at Link Healthcare Advantage, LLC
Nice tool to keep track of my project hours.
It's easy to switch between projects and start and stop the clock. It is easy to obtain a weekly sum of working time for each project, which is just what I need.
— Hanne Heiberg, senior scientist at Norwegian Meteorological Institute
Nice tool to keep track of my project hours. I have been working freelance marketing/design/web dev for a year now after being laid off from my full-time position last November. I was never a fan of logging my time. I usually could just guesstimate and put it into a janky google spreadsheet until I was ready to invoice. The last few months have picked up so much that my old method of time-tracking and sheet-making was getting cumbersome and hard to keep track. In September,
I found Clockify and it has been such a helpful tool for my freelancing.
It is so easy to use, clean interface, well organized, and free. I just love it! Anyways, just wanted to pass along my thanks for creating this great tool.
— Sadie Lesko, freelancer
Excellent time tracking software for any complexity of project.
The interface is functional, looks good, and is very easy to use. Also the ability to track anything from a simple job to a complex project is great as well.
— Johnny Unger, draftsman at FIM
I absolutely love this.
Started using it last week and it's amazing.

Regarding the things i like honestly first thing that attracted me is the price. Comparing to other similar solutions this is super cheep, please stay that way :). Other than that it meet my needs as my architectural office runs multiple projects and tasks, so
it's quite easy to track time and resources.
— Milan Sijakov, CEO and Senior Architect at Krop Studio
Your interface is far superior

I love that you developed this app. You see, i was looking for alternatives because yes, i have been working with Toggl for 2 years now, and have a lot of time tracking reports there. Everything was fine, because i had a team of 5. But now, the moment we are about to go to 6 employees, i need more. And
your app looks and feels the same as Toggl, but a little bit more elegant
. i like that. i love that i can just log in, search for a date, and figure out how much time it took us to finish a project, so we can project realistic deadlines for future projects.
— Mark Diaz, C.E.O. at 2D Animation 101
Fantastic system,
everything we actually needed from Toggl, but free!

Amazing value
, great product, easy to use
— Stephen Edwards
I am more than impressed with your platform and cannot express how helpful it has been.
Even on the free plan we have everything we need. Not only that but that API you guys have is extremely well documented and just generally amazing. I will be bringing my entire team onto this platform soon (40-50 employees) and we look forward to using your platform. Saved me from having to build a timesheet tracker myself, allowing me to focus on my website and APIs. So, a huge thanks from me to you!

I am very impressed with this software, it is a fantastic addition to our operating software.
— Stuart Goodswen, Managing Directo at Goodswen Pro-Design Limited
Great free time tracking tool.
Love that it's free! The Chrome extension is really helpful - I like the option to track time manually or with a timer, as well as being able to add notes to the time quickly.
— Emily H., Account Manager at 15C
Clockify exceeded my expectations. i am canceling my current, premium, time tracking service.
Clockify is free but provides a great level of control for what it does. Very excited to see Clockify being under continuous development.

We were using Toggl and then discovered Clockify. Really great job,
the app is done much better than Toggl!
— Daniel Kuttner, croox GmbH
I just have to say, from the perspective of a former web designer/developer, your product is amazing. It is easily the best time tracking tool I've found in the last several weeks that I've been looking. The way the browser extensions seamlessly integrate tools like Trello is fantastic. I'm looking forward to integrating this into the workflow at our company - i think it's going to be quite revolutionary. i also appreciate the number of features that you have made available at the free and low-cost tier.
It definitely helps a small company like ours
to be able to adopt such beneficial tools when they are so reasonable with price structure.
— Jason Sims, Digital Services Director, Xeusa LLC
You guys are amazing
, thank you for creating this awesome website, i will upgrade my account very soon :)
— Dusan Bartolovic

I just want to thank you all for this wonderful app you created.

— Igor Torres
Love this app. It's exactly what I was hoping to find!

It is very convenient and great to use. Especially appreciate the free aspect. I recommend to anyone and everyone who needs this type of software.
— Raina Winfrey
We recently have started using clocking in our software startup and
it has been an awesome experience!
We are very happy with the product and the API feature has allowed us to migrate our time tracking Excel spreadsheets to the platform, that was cool.
— Andres Stang, Eppical
We have been using your software for over a year now.
You have fantastic uptime and you have a simple and easy to use UI.
Like github you seem to roll features out slowly and carefully with some built in advertisement for your new features. Please keep keeping it simple!.
— Simon Beverton, Future Wonder Co
I started using Clockify at home to track time I spend working on various hobby projects. It has worked really nicely for that.
It is so nice that I have started using the free version at my office to track my work time.
Again, I am very pleased with your product. Thank you for the fine product. I use Clockify for two purposes: one to track personal time I spend on hobby and other non-work tasks and the other for logging time at my office. I was previously using a simple spreadsheet to keep track of my time at work which I would transfer to our offices "official" timesheet. I still have to create the official timesheet, but now I use an export of the weekly Detail report.
— William Frame, Community Action Partnership of Madera County
Clockify exemplifies a quote written on an Apple marketing brochure in 1977.
"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."
The Clockify UI is clean, uncluttered, simple, intuitive and functionally complete. It did everything I expected and more. Kudos to your team and company.
— Frank Zwolinski
Just started using Clockify -
very useful app
, i really appreciate it.
— Norbert Szabo
I have a 55 person staff team. Each person on the team can work on one of six different projects over the course of a 2-week pay period. We used to have a paper timesheet with six different columns, one for each project, where the staff would fill in their hours for the correct project and day. When the time came to process those timesheets and send the information to our payroll department, I had to collect 55 timesheets and calculate totals for each project and day. Needless to say, it took a substantial amount of time to complete. Then we found Clockify. It is very simple and allows our staff to enter start and end time for activities in an app. I can then see in the Dashboard who has worked where and when, and complete my payroll. I can also generate a spreadsheet and store it for archive and auditing purposes. Because I work at a charity organization, and we have little to no budget, the fact that Clockify is free for unlimited number is users is a major plus.
Clockify is just what I need. It's simple enough that people will use it, and it gives me access to the backend information for calculating payroll.
— Steve Wideman, Director of Community Programs, YMCA of Niagara
THANK YOU for making a free time tracking app!
— Ludovic Maillard
I like your services and now use them every day. the calendar is my favorite as I currently use google calendar to track my whole life. i don't think you can offer me anything i want outside of what you provide already....... I'm still exploring the features. tagging I'm thinking about, and projects too. I think I'm using some things wrong that'll bite me soon but all well. anyway, this app rocks and even though I don't need any of the upgrades,
i'mma pay you because you deserve to be paid for this service
.
— Jessica Harpley
Thank you for truly easy to use time tracker software.
It is so intuitive, i barely looked at a tutorial video.
That is the FIRST sign of great software and UI/UX designers who really care.
— Allen Hobbs
First off, i love your product! i finally took a dive in doing some freelance work and
tracking my time is a breeze with your product
(to a point where I'm looking for more things to do just to be able to track them :) ). Needless to say, I'm tracking some personal project as well as work-related projects just because i can.
— Ksenia S
Thank you for the possibility to use Clockify, It turned out to be a
very convenient and simple time tracker
among 5 other ones i tried.
— Helen Kapatsa
Thank you for making an awesome time tracker. i have been using your tracker for some time and i am
very happy with it
.
— Doros Agathangelou
It works well directly in most of my most commonly used tools, like Google Docs, Gmail, Google Calendar, and a whole lot more. I can quickly tap the clock and it will record how long I'm working on a given document, email, meeting, etc. It's helpful in tracking productivity as well as where I'm putting in too many or not enough hours. I don't spend any time setting it up, I just go about my day and let it work in the background.
Overall, I've had a lot of success in keeping track of the hours it takes to complete new tasks, which helps me budget time in the future.
Other tools have become problematic in the past, but it's hard to miss the on/off switch with Clockify.
— Sam Rinaldo
I really like your system. i have been using it for the past two months now for all the projects at work.
I have even introduced our team to Clockify to keep up to date on workings within our projects

I've been loving your service! I was a long time Toggl user, then happened to come across your service somehow,

— Alex, COO at Saphe Web Design
I love this app.
Please don't change it
and make it impossible for regular people like me to access like quickbooks does. This is exactly what I need. Something simple and robust. Nothing crazy. You're doing a great job!

Your platform is amazing.
— Arnaldo Trezzi

great platform that solve my headache of billable hours to my customer.
Intuitive and amazingly rich features.

A good option for time tracking.
Easy to use .Continues tracking over different devices and allows you to have multiple clients.
— Alex Taylor, freelancer
Starting up a small business and serving multiple clients has proved to become a little hectic for us at times. We quickly realized that to keep track of everything we were working on, we needed systems in place to help us manage it all.
We've found that the app Clockify has been incredibly helpful in keeping track of our hours for our clients.
We've been able to add each of our clients and all the projects we have on the go for them. Now every time we start working on a client we start the timer for that particular project and it logs what we are doing and how long we spend on it. We value transparency with our clients so it's a really good way for them to know exactly what you worked on and how long it took you. It even generates detailed invoices for you to give to your client! Oh - and it's FREE!

Love the simplicity of the user interface and the ease of navigation.
— Farrah Selleck, Adm. Assistant at FSDB
I have just started using Clockify and loved it very much. Thank you for making such an amazing app.
I think i have explored and tried more than 50 time tracking apps, but none seemed good enough.
— Salman Mitha
A huge thank you for this simple device. I'm not interested in tracking my time for expenses, but in learning more about how inefficiently my time is being used. In just two days it has made me more intentional in staying on task, because the timer is on.
It's a breakthrough for me, and I love it!
— Kate Bowles, Associate Dean at Faculty of Law, Humanities & Arts
First of all, i am very glad to you serving this kind of service as free of charge. i am working on in a small company that develops tech and advertising ideas in Ankara, Turkey. We are hiring 20-25 persons, but we want to grow up. Increasing the efficiency and productivity is the best way to grow up. In order to achieve this, we realize that we simply record and report working hours of teams.
We tried different time tracking softwares such as Toggl, Timely, Timedoctor, Harvest etc. But, as you know and said, all of them are too expensive and complex. Then, we found Clockify, first hand we could not believe that it is free of charge, but it really looks like
. Thank you!

I'd like to congrats to you for your great service.

I'm enjoying Clockify for more than 1 year and I've been able to track all my tasks, thanks to your amazing tool. It is time for me to pay my share and show my appreciation so I've upgrade to the Basic plan (for now).

Thank you to offer your tool for free, it really helped convinced me that you have the best time tracking tool out there

Recommendation: For anyone wanting to track work hours and salary of their staff via an online platform, i highly recommend Clockify!
We use it in C&S Earthquake Ltd. to log our staff's hours and it's completely free (forever). It allows you to set up different tasks for staff to log hours, and gives you live reports on how much their work is costing you.

I love to pay you
10$/month, because like you i think this is just fair and not on a user base. 😊
