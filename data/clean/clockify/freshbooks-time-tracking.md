I love Clockify's ease of use and smart reporting
We used to collate this data on individual time sheet spreadsheets, which required manual input and reporting, and hours of time. Clockify takes a few minutes a week to fill in for each team member, and reporting is so simple and is instantaneous when you select your reporting criteria and filters.

I used to get myself in a mess with Excel timesheets
Clockify is ideal for my needs. I work part-time for a client working as his executive assistant and his bookkeeper. I was getting myself in a mess just using a timesheet created in MS Excel and when I discovered Clockify I was over the moon with joy. I keep Clockify open in the background and I switch projects when I start the work and when I finish the work. I used to under invoice for my time and lose income but now I can bill for every second I work on his projects. Also, it has great reporting function and can either print off or save as a PDF or Excel etc. So not only do I invoice my client, I've also got exact data for the time I carry out each of his tasks
