How to track time in Azure DevOps
Start timer inside Azure DevOps
Clockify timer button will automatically appear in all Azure DevOps work items.
(Note: If you have a self-hosted version of Azure DevOps Server, you'll need to open "Integrations" in the extension, scroll down to the bottom, select Azure and type your custom domain, without the "https://" part.)
Timer starts ticking
Clockify will pick up Azure DevOps's work item name and the timer will start ticking. You can stop the timer from anywhere (browser, mobile, or desktop).
Sync projects
If there's a project in Clockify that matches the project in Azure, the extension will automatically select the project.
Extension can also create projects in Clockify based on information in Azure. You can enable this in the extension's Settings.
Run time reports and manage projects
In the web version, you can edit past entries, analyze time, manage projects, invite people, review timesheets, and export reports.
