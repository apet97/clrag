How Clockify works
Set up projects
Create projects, categorize them by clients, and create tasks on projects. Then, all you have to do is choose a project/task, write an optional description of what you're doing, and start the timer.
Track time
Track time you spend on activities with a single click using a timer or you can use automatic time tracker. You can also enter missing time manually.
You can track time in the browser, or via desktop and mobile app (iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Linux). Desktop app comes packed with useful time tracking features like auto tracker, reminders, idle detection, and more.
Set hourly rates
Set hourly rate for each employee and project. All your team has to do is mark their time entries as billable and Clockify will automatically calculate the billable amount.
Run reports
You can run an online report and break down billable data however you need, and later export as PDF, Excel, or CSV, or share a link to the live report with your client.
Record expenses
Create expenses for project fixed fees and other types of expenses (by sum or unit), and attach receipts.
Set budget and create invoice
Set fixed fee projects (in time or money), choose if it resets each month, and later create invoices for all your worked billable hours and expenses.
