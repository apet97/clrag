Habits and Daily Routines of Successful People
“I'll do it tomorrow.” This counterproductive mindset is exactly what’s keeping you from reaching your goals.
Big names have been there too, so they’ve fine-tuned their routines to perfection.
Clearly, habits and routines matter in your pursuit of success — but they’re innately different.
So, let’s compare these 2 concepts and explore the daily routines of successful people to see how you can maximize productivity.
What is the difference between routines and habits?
Although habits and routines are both regular and repeated activities, there’s a difference between them.
According to a study on habitual behavior, we engage in habits subconsciously. Still, we rely on cues to remind us to start our habitual actions.
For example, you may have a habit of brushing your teeth right after eating. So, finishing a meal and leaving your dining table would be your cue to head for the bathroom.
But, can routines also become second nature?
Unlike habits, routine behavior doesn’t depend on a trigger but requires conscious and deliberate effort.
For instance, a part of your daily routine may be going for a run. But, even if you enjoy physical activity, you’re not likely to walk outside and start running on autopilot.
In short, habits are automatic behaviors triggered by a cue while routines require intentional practice.
Why are routines and habits important?
The road to success is paved with consistent action.
So, forming established routines and healthy habits is the best way to remain steadfast in chasing your goals.
Developing productive habits has many merits — whether you're focused on a particular goal or not.
According to a paper on lifestyle behaviors, habitual actions can improve your quality of life by promoting creativity and better mental health.
When we form a habit out of a daily, time-consuming task, it becomes automatic and no longer demands our full attention. While that task is at the back of our minds, we can shift our focus to creative thinking.
Daily routines and habits of successful people
There’s no ultimate recipe for success. Still, routines and habits are a vital addition to the daily lives of many productive individuals. So, there must be a connection.
Let's connect the dots by looking at the daily routines of successful people and their list of habits.
#1: Barack Obama’s daily routine
The 44th president of the United States contributed to multiple changes in his country. But, with change came great responsibility, along with a jam-packed schedule.
As a self-proclaimed night owl, Obama frequently worked late into the night to manage his heavy workload.

What do successful people have in common?
Based on the daily habits of successful people, here are the main commonalities that form a productive routine.
Strict schedule
The daily routines of famous personalities rarely change, which helps them maintain a healthy work-life balance.
According to the daily rituals of successful leaders, following a consistent routine keeps distractions at bay and raises your productivity levels.
Getting up early
Many entrepreneurs are early birds. After all, morning people tend to have healthy sleep patterns, leading to more energy, better organization, and higher efficiency.
As mentioned in our schedule examples, the best morning routine includes self-care activities, like:
- Showering,
- Eating breakfast,
- Meditation,
- Working out, etc.
Exercising
Most successful people engage in some form of daily exercise — from walking to working out. Overall, regular physical activity is tied to better focus and lower stress levels.
Interestingly, a survey on morning vs. night workouts shows that people who exercise in the morning are 129% more likely to believe it improves productivity at work.
However, if you're most productive in the morning, we suggest you prioritize work and exercise later.
Eating breakfast
Most successful people don’t skip the first meal of the day. Likewise, you should start your day with breakfast to get the initial energy boost you need for the day’s activities.
In fact, nutritionists advise against skipping breakfast since it negatively affects your mental performance — especially your memory and concentration.
Time blocking
Crafting a schedule means you've allocated a specific time to each activity. But some entrepreneurs take this to the next level.
For example, Musk assigns different days to different companies while Dorsey dedicates each day to a certain work area. Others complete their work in multiple sessions, taking productive breaks in between, like Sigmund Freud.
With time blocking, you can achieve daily goals and prevent burnout by scheduling leisure activities.
A day in the life of an American
The American Time Use Survey (ATUS) revealed the average amount of time Americans spent on regular activities in 2023:
- Sleep — People slept for 9.1 hours every day.
- Work — People spent 8.1 hours on work and work-related activities. On workdays, home-based employees worked for 5.1 hours, and in-office employees did so for 7.9 hours.
- Leisure — People invested 5.5 hours in leisure and sports activities — like socializing, watching television, or exercising. On average, men spent 5.6 hours on these activities, while women spent 4.8 hours.
- Household chores — People did household activities for 2.4 hours every day. Specifically, women spent 2.7 hours on chores while men spent 2.1 hours.
- Childcare — Adults with children under age 6 spent circa 2.3 hours providing primary childcare — activities including physical care, playing, and sharing hobbies with children. However, parents with children between 6 and 17 spent only 52 minutes on their care.
For the average Joe, sleep and work take up most of the day, followed by leisure activities, housework, and childcare.
How can you become a highly productive person?
The daily routines of successful people prove that consistency is key to increasing your productivity levels. Still, that doesn’t explain how you can adjust your list of habits for that purpose.
So, here are our top 4 tips for creating a successful routine that you’ll stick to.
1) Prioritize your night routine
The best morning routine starts with a good night’s rest. However, that will depend on how you spend your evenings. That’s why you should put your nights first when planning a schedule.
A study on the effects of sleep quality confirms that sleep deprivation causes job stress, and, by default, productivity loss. Based on over 3,000 responses, the survey shows that:
- 41.1% of participants have sleep problems, and
- 55.3% of participants have occupational stress.
But, how can you tell if your sleep schedule is off?
First, ask yourself the following questions:
- How would you describe your sleep quality?
- How many hours of shuteye do you get per night?
If the answers suggest something wrong about your sleep pattern, make changes to increase productivity.
To fix your sleep schedule and get 7-9 hours of shuteye, research on sleep health advises you to:
- Set up your sleep and wake-up time,
- Exercise for at least 30 minutes during the day,
- Avoid smoking and drinking coffee and alcohol before bed,
- Avoid watching TV or using your smartphone before sleep, and
- Do a relaxing activity before bedtime — like a warm shower or reading.
Improving your sleep habits is a necessary step toward boosting your work performance and overall health.
2) Leverage your peak productivity time
To form a winning daily routine, you need to identify your peak productivity hours or your biological prime time — the time of day when you experience optimal energy and focus. Taking advantage of your most productive hours will help you avoid overwork.
To illustrate, imagine you're a UX designer whose main focus is research analysis. If you start your day by checking emails and delay important tasks, you may end up working overtime.
So, what’s the best strategy to use your peak productive hours?
You can try time tracking to ensure you finish the toughest tasks during your focus time. By tracking time spent per task, you can easily figure out how long it takes you to complete it.
As a result, you'll be able to pinpoint the exact parts of the day when certain tasks come easier to you. And here’s how you get there.
On Monday, upon logging into the time tracking app, do one of your most important tasks first. Simply start the timer and stop once you finish each task.
On Tuesday, start your task later in the day and let the timer tell you how long you've worked on it.
After a while, you'll have enough data to recognize a pattern in your workflow. With this information, you can organize your work schedule to fit the biggest tasks into your most productive hours.
3) Don’t ignore your to-do list
Many people create to-do lists only to push them aside during work. Others fail to check off all of the list items for various reasons — whether it's additional work or a poorly planned day.
Regardless, following to-do lists should be part of your daily routine — with undeniable pros like:
- Better task prioritization,
- Sense of accomplishment,
- Reduced stress,
- Improved focus, and
- Increased productivity.
But, how can you use your to-do lists effectively?
According to research on to-do lists, only around 40% of tasks get checked off. So, make sure that your priorities are included in that percentage. The study provides other useful tips, such as:
- Set realistic time estimates,
- Include no more than 7 activities,
- Write down tasks in specific terms,
- Move unfinished tasks onto tomorrow’s checklist, and
- Create your list at the end of the previous day to avoid procrastination.
Generally, creating checklists gives you a sense of order and sets a clear intention — improving your chances of following through.
4) Make time for self-care
Finding enough time for self-care activities before jumping into work can decrease your chances of burnout and ensure optimal productivity.
The facts speak for themselves: Health experts on burnout prevention say that people who spend 20% of their time on personal interests are less likely to experience burnout.
Based on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the most popular leisure activities are:
- Watching TV,
- Socializing,
- Relaxing and thinking,
- Playing games,
- Reading, and
- Doing sports and recreational activities.
Despite your often chaotic schedule, try to set aside at least 15-20 minutes of self-care time. Drinking a glass of water only takes a moment! This practice will help you perk up, recharge, and handle the rest of the day without feeling overwhelmed.
