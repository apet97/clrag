Create projects & clients
10 min read
Projects are useful for grouping and
categorizing time entries
that belong to the same type of work. Projects make it easier to analyze data, generate more useful reports, and see where and how you spend time.
Each project typically belongs to some client, but you can create a project without a client (e.g. internal company stuff). A client can have multiple projects, but a project can belong to only one client.
You can also
import projects and clients
from a file.
For an overall guidance on projects, watch the video and follow the instructions below.
User interface displayed in this video may not correspond to the latest version of the app.
Create projects
#
By default, only admins can create projects. However, this set of permissions can be modified if
Who can create projects and clients
is set to
Admins and managers
or
Anyone
in the
Workspace settings
.
Who can create projects if selected:
Admins
(default): admins
Admins and project managers
: admins and project manager
Anyone
: admins, projects managers, team managers, regular users
The person who creates the project automatically becomes its project manager meaning that they can view all tracked time on their projects, set estimates, add tasks, manage project access and modify all other aspects of the project.
To create a project:
Go to Projects and click
Create new project
Name the project
Select client (you can also create a new client here, by typing a name and clicking
Create client
)
Choose a project color from the
Custom
section or
color picker
Choose visibility (public or private)
Click
Create
Once you’ve created a project, you can select it when tracking time. If you’ve set the project as private (visible only to a certain
group
), then only people who are on the project will be able to select it when tracking time. You can also adjust the size of columns (name, client, status, access) to make sure all data is properly displayed.
If you use the Clockify browser extension, you can track time on projects and tasks from the
Projects
page.
For more information, check out the
Browser extension
page.
Quick create
#
You can also add a project directly from the project picker while creating a new time entry.
Click on the
+Project
field to get a drop-down list of projects and start typing the name of your new project. Once you start typing the drop-down list will try to suggest a matching (existing) project name.
If that project does not exist, you will be offered the option to create a new project.
Click on the
+ Create new project
button and a popup window with additional options will appear allowing you to name your project, assign a client, apply a project template and select if the project will be public or private.
You can also use a keyboard shortcut
Ctrl /
^ (Control) + Enter
to quickly create a project without additional details.
Color picker
#
The
Custom
section in the
color picker
for Projects allows you to save up to 8 custom colors.
If you haven’t used custom colors yet, the section will show a
+
sign prompting you to add new ones.
Custom colors are consistent across all devices and modes.
Archive projects
#
Once you complete a project, you can archive it, so it’s no longer visible when tracking time.
To archive a project:
Go to the
Projects
page
Click three dots next to the project you want to archive
Select
Archive
You can check the
Also mark all tasks as done
box in a screen that pops up requiring you to confirm the action and all the tasks in the archived project will be marked as
done
.
Once the project is archived you will be able to delete it.
To see archived projects
, click the
Active
filter at the top of the page, change it to
Archived
and click
APPLY FILTER
to confirm the action.
To restore an archived project
, click three dots next to it and select
Restore
.
When you archive a project:
All its data is still available
Project’s time entries will still be shown in reports
Archived projects won’t appear in reports as filters unless you select
All
or
Archived
Archived projects won’t be available in the project picker when creating new time entries
Archived projects won’t appear on
Projects
page (unless you select
Archived in the filter
)
You can also archive tags and clients the same way you can archive projects.
Delete projects
#
Projects can only be deleted once they are archived.
To delete a project:
Go to Projects page
Select
Archived
or
All
from the drop-down menu
Click three dots next to the archived project’s name
Select
Delete
Confirm the action
Deleting a project will remove it from all time entries it is assigned to, but time will remain.
Merge projects
#
While it’s not possible to merge projects, you can filter entries of one of the projects you want to merge and assign it to the other project
in the Detailed report
.
It is also possible to update multiple time entries at the same time with the
Bulk edit
feature in the Detailed report.
Then, simply
archive
and
delete
the project you don’t need.
Manage people on projects
#
To see how to change the project’s privacy settings, manage user access to a project, or set users as project managers, visit
this help article
.
Project status
#
When you and your team start tracking time for projects and tasks, you’ll be able to track progress on each project using Project status.
To learn more about how to use project status, visit
this help article
.
Project note
#
You can add additional information to projects by using a project note.  To learn more about how to format a project note, visit
this help article
.
Project name/client/color
#
If you need to edit project name, client, color, or any other type of project setting, you can do that in the
Settings
tab.
Go to the Projects page
Choose the project
Switch to the Project settings tab
Edit project name, change/add client/project color
Changes you make will be immediately visible.
Set project’s billable rate
#
Clockify has 4 types of
billable rates
, one of which is the project billable rate. If set, this billable rate gets applied to each time entry created for this project.
The project billable rate can be overwritten by Projects’ member rate which you define in the
projects’ Access
tab if you want different users on the project to have different billable rates.
To set a billable rate for a specific project:
Go to the Projects page
Click on the name of the specific project
Switch to the Project settings tab
Set billable rate for the project
To set different pricing per client at the project level:
Create different projects
Assign them to respective clients
Go to Projects and click the project name (which will bring you to Project edit page)
Switch to the Project Settings tab
Set the desired billable rate for the project.
Repeat for each project for the specific client
Filter and sort projects
#
When you have a lot of projects, it can be difficult finding what you need. That’s when filters come in handy.
You can filter projects by their active status, client, users who are part of it, billability, and name.
You can sort projects alphabetically by clicking
Name
on the header of the project table. It is possible to sort projects by Client and Status as well.
Create project from a template
#
If you have a lot of similar projects, it’s a good idea to set up a template so you don’t have to create the same project over and over.
Projects you create with an existing template will have settings such as Billable Rates, Estimates, Tasks and Team already applied.
Project templates
are a paid feature, which you can enable once you upgrade your account.
Add and edit tasks in a bulk
#
Admins and owners can add and edit multiple tasks to multiple projects in a bulk. This option is available with all paid subscription plans.
After selecting projects, user can modify visibility, access, client, color, billability and tasks in the
Bulk edit
screen.
By modifying tasks, user can be adding and editing the tasks in the selected projects.
If the
Add to existing
option is selected, user is adding a task to all the selected projects. Up to 20 tasks can be added.
If the
Overwrite existing
option is selected, user is deleting all active and completed tasks in the selected projects and adding the newly created tasks.
After all the changes are saved, the newly added tasks will be visible in the task list in the alphabetical order.
Manage clients
#
By default,
owners
and
admins
can create clients. However, this set of permissions can be modified if
Who can create projects and clients

.
Who can create clients if selected:
Admins
(default): admins
Admins and project managers
