Projects
page in the sidebar

Settings
tab

The budget forecasting chart is made out of the values on the X and Y axes, with the intersection representing the data points
All numerical values follow your
Workspace settings
for formatting
Values are displayed with two decimal places, and the currency is determined by your Workspace settings or a specific client
Y axis
:
Represents monetary values (amount of money)
The minimal value is where the two axes first intersect, while the maximal value is the highest point on the chart within the selected date range
Only numbers are shown, excluding currency symbols
X axis
:
Displays dates, with the time range adjustable at the top right corner of the page
Horizontal line above the Y axis represents the project’s budget. This status line adjusts if the project’s budget changes, including weekly, monthly, or annual resets.
When the project’s budget is exceeded, the forecasted line will continue beyond the estimated budget line, reflecting continued expenses.
For example:
If the budget for the initial months of the year was $5,000 and $150 was spent, the budget line will be positioned on the chart according to its value relative to the Y axis.
