Create & manage projects & clients on workspace level
7 min read
As a Workspace admin or Owner, you’ll play a key role in creating and managing projects and clients. This will help your team organize their time, track progress, and optimize workflows. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about setting up, managing, and maintaining projects and clients in your workspace.
Key concepts
#
Projects
#
Projects are essential for categorizing and grouping time entries based on the type of work being done. They help you analyze data, generate reports, and track the time spent on different tasks.
A project can only belong to one client but a client can have multiple projects.
Projects can be
private
(visible only to selected users) or
public
(visible to everyone in the workspace). Projects are useful for tracking time, setting estimates, assigning tasks, and reporting.
Clients
#
Clients are the entities or individuals for whom you are doing work. Clients can be linked to multiple projects, and each project can belong to only one client.
Create projects
#
As an Admin or Owner, you have the ability to create projects for your workspace. Here’s how you can do it:
Who can create projects?
#
By default, only
Admins
can create projects. However, this setting can be changed to allow
Admins and Project Managers
or
Anyone
in the workspace to create projects. You can modify this setting in
Workspace settings
.
Steps to create a project:
Go to the
Projects
page
Click
Create new project
Enter
project name
Select a client
If the client doesn’t exist, you can create a new one right from the project creation screen if you type the name and click
Create client
Choose
project color
to help visually distinguish your project
Set visibility
Choose between
Public
or
Private
visibility
Click
Create
Once the project is created, it will be available for time tracking. If the project is set to
private
, only users assigned to the project will be able to track time under it.
Quickly create project
#
You can also create a project while creating a new time entry:
In the
Time tracker
page, click on the
+Project
field
Start typing the project name
If the project doesn’t exist, you’ll be prompted to
Create new project
Enter the necessary details such as
project name
,
client
,
visibility
, etc.
You can also use the keyboard shortcut
Ctrl/^(Control)+Enter
to quickly create a project.

Archive projects
#
Once a project is completed, you can archive it to keep your workspace organized.

Go to the
Projects
page
Click the
three dots
next to the project name
Select

You can choose to mark all tasks as done during this action
Click

to archive the project
Restore archived projects
#
To access archived projects again:
Change the
Active filter
to
Archived
at the top of the
Projects
page
Click
Apply filter
To restore the project, click the
three dots
next to the archived project and select
Restore
Delete projects
#
You can delete a project only after it has been archived. Once deleted, the project will be removed from time entries but the time data remains intact.
Steps to delete project:
Go to the
Projects
page
Change the filter to
Archived
or
All
Click the
three dots
next to the archived project name
Select

and

Merge projects
#
While it is not possible to directly
merge projects
, you can:
Filter the time entries of one project and assign them to another project
Use the
bulk edit
feature to update multiple time entries at once in the
Detailed report
Once you’ve reassigned the time entries, you can archive and delete the project you no longer need.
Manage project access & permissions
#
As a
project manager
, you have control over who can access the project, modify tasks, and track time under it. You can also assign users as
project managers
for specific projects.
To learn more about how to manage users on a project, please refer to our
Manage users on projects
help article.
Project status & notes
#
Each project can have a status (e.g. In progress, completed) to help track its progress.
Project status
: You can update the status as you track time and progress
Project notes
: Add additional context or instructions to the project by using the project note feature. This is especially useful for providing key details to the team working on the project.
Edit project name, client, or color
#
To edit a project’s settings such as its name, client, or color:
Go to the
Projects
page
Click on the project you want to edit
Switch to the
Settings
tab
Make changes to
name
,
client
, and
project color
These changes will be updated immediately across the workspace.
Setting billable rates for projects
#
You can define a
billable rate
for each project to ensure that time entries are tracked correctly.
Steps to set a billable rate for a project:
Go to the
Projects
page
Click the project you want to update
Switch to the
Settings
tab
Set the
Billable rate
for the project
You can also set different rates per user in the

if you want to apply specific rates to different team members.
Filter and sort projects
#
With many projects in your workspace, it can be hard to keep track. Use filters and sorting options to easily find the projects you’re looking for.
Filter by
: Active status, client, project users, billability, or name
Sort by
: Name, Client, or Status
Create projects from templates
#
To avoid recreating similar projects repeatedly, you can use
project templates
. This feature is available with paid plans and allows you to create projects with pre-set settings (billable rates, tasks, estimates, etc.).
To create a project from a template:
When creating a new project, select
project template
from the templates you saved
The settings from the template will be automatically applied to the new project.
Bulk add and edit tasks
#
Admins and Owners can add and edit multiple tasks across several projects at once. This is useful for organizing large numbers of tasks.
Steps for bulk task management:
Select the projects you want to update
Use the
bulk edit screen
to modify visibility, access, client, color, billability, and tasks
You can add new tasks to multiple projects or overwrite existing tasks in bulk
