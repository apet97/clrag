How to track time in Github
Step 3
Start timer inside Github
Clockify timer button will automatically appear in all Github issues and merge requests.
(Note: If you have a self-hosted version of Github, you'll need to open "Integrations" in the extension, scroll down to the bottom, select Github and type your custom domain, without the "https://" part.)
Step 4
Timer starts ticking
Clockify will pick up Github's issue name and the timer will start ticking. You can stop the timer from anywhere (browser, mobile, or desktop).
Step 5
Run time reports and manage projects
In the web version, you can edit past entries, analyze time, manage projects, invite people, review timesheets, and export reports.
