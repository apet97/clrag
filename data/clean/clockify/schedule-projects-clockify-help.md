Schedule projects
2 min read
Scheduling projects simplifies project planning and task delegation. You can visualize project timelines, see projected costs and billable amounts, assign tasks to team members and use the Team view to manage their availability. Stay organized and improve team collaboration.
Scheduling is a paid feature, which you can enable by
upgrading
your workspace to the PRO or ENTERPRISE plan.
Scheduling can be performed by Admins. Project managers can only schedule their own projects.
User interface displayed in this video may not correspond to the latest version of the app.
To schedule projects and team, activate
project and team scheduling
in the Workspace settings.
