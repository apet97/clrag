Why keep track of employee attendance
Keeping employee attendance records at work helps both remote and office-based companies identify and address a number of matters:
Identify any attendance-related issues in your company
Reduce absenteeism
Improve employee productivity and morale through accurate and timely time-off requests and approvals
Make it easier to schedule vacations on the whole
Embrace working remotely
Ensure employees are paid on time
Analyze employee productivity to make better scheduling decisions
Analyze employee productivity to make better  hiring decisions
Tracking attendance
is also useful when you want to compare employee attendance with the
time employees spend on sick leave, personal leave, or vacations
.
In order to track your employees' attendance, it's best that you use a staff attendance register. Depending on the type of the employee attendance records you're using, you and your employees will be able to mark, track, and view:
Employee time in and time out for the day
Attendance per day, week, month, or year
Break time per day
The days employees spend on personal leave
The days employees spend on sick leave
The days employees spend on vacation
Whether some of your employees are not showing up to work, but offering no timely explanation as to why
To help you track this data, here are 12 employee attendance templates you, your HR team, or your employees can easily fill out in Excel or Google Sheets, and which you or your HR team can later analyze and draw valuable conclusions from.

Why you should use attendance tracking software
When it comes to the
best ways to track employee attendance
, tracking attendance by using templates is simple and easy.
But, it has its limitations.
Namely, tracking attendance with a template is suitable only if your company has a smaller number of employees, so you can easily track and manually add correct information for everyone.
However, perhaps your company has the policy to measure sick leave, personal leave, or
vacation time
in
hours
, instead of days.
And, perhaps you want more detailed insights into the activities, tasks, and assignments your employees actually engage in while attending work.
In such a case, using a time tracking tool that allows the automating tracking of attendance for your team through different projects is the best solution.
Clockify
is a time tracking software that allows you to easily track time on all company-related "projects", including work attendance, break time per day, but also absent days caused by sick leave, personal leave, or vacations. Here's how.
Sign up for Clockify FREE
How to track attendance with Clockify
To track employee attendance in the easiest way with Clockify, simply invite your team to your company workspace, and provide instructions:
Each time an employee arrives at the office (or sits down in front of the computer to work from home), he or she should
start the timer
on the Time Tracking page of the app.
As an alternative, employees can add the time they worked on manually, after they are done with work for the day.
Apart from this simple
clock-in, clock-out approach
, you can also use Clockify to track the tasks and activities your employees engage in
while
at work.
If you're working on multiple work projects, define separate Clockify projects for them, and instruct employees to select and track time on these projects when working on them.
To have employees track their breaks, simply define a project called "Breaks" and have employees track the time they spend on short breaks or on lunch breaks.
Once you define a couple of projects, your employees will also be able to log their hours in a simple
timesheet
.
To streamline your workflow, you can also add specific tasks to projects, write descriptions for each
time entry
, define tags to specify the type of task being worked on, and more.
Later on, you can go to the
Reports
of the app and see at a glance who worked when, for how long, and on what. You may find the Weekly Report especially useful, as it shows you a simple and easy-to-read breakdown of the times your employees were at work on a weekly basis.
How to track absence with Clockify
Apart from tracking attendance, you can also easily track absence with Clockify, by creating several suitable projects for this and then having employees track time on them.
For starters, you can follow the outline of the listed attendance tracking templates, and create and name separate projects for "Sick Leave", "Vacations", "Personal Leave".
Or, depending on the time-off policy and workflow of your company, you can expand on this basic time off data, and have employees track time for "Half-days", "Family Leave", "Unpaid Leave", "Personal Time", and more.
However you choose to track employee time off, you'll easily be able to create projects for each type of leave in a couple of clicks.
Track leave with Clockify
Afterward, your employees can track this time just like they would track their work hours:
with a timer
by adding time manually
by adding time in a timesheet
If the regular workday in your company is 8 hours, then you should instruct employees to add 8 hours for time off as well.
Later on, you'll be able to view and analyze employee absence in the Reports Section of the app, and even compare absences with attendance, if you choose to view a report of all your Clockify projects at once.
