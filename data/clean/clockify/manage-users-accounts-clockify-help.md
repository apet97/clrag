1 min read
Control accounts is a paid feature, which you can enable by
upgrading
your workspace to the Enterprise plan.
Gain complete control over users’ accounts on your workspace, so that you can:
See when user joined
Deactivate user’s API key
Log in as user (if you’re on subdomain, you’ll only be able to log in as that user inside your workspace)
Stop timer for another user
Only the workspace owner has access to the Accounts tab in the
Workspace settings
.
Deactivate API key
#
This page doesn’t display the API keys themselves, but it shows how many active keys each user has.
If you need to stop an API from working:
Click the
three-dots menu
next to the user whose API key you want to deactivate
Choose
Deactivate API key
Click
Deactivate
to confirm the action
After being deactivated, that API key can no longer be used and its status will be automatically updated on the
Manage API keys
page.
