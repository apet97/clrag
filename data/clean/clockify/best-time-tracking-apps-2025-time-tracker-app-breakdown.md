How I chose which time tracking apps to review
With so many time tracking apps on the market, I needed to establish some ground rules for selecting the ones that would make it to the final list.
Here are the key criteria I considered when making my selection:
Usability
— a time tracker app should be simple to use, allowing users to track time effortlessly and streamline their workflow.
Core and additional features
— aside from core timekeeping functionalities such as a timer and a manual-entry option, a great time tracker should also offer extra features like scheduling or advanced analytics.
Affordability
— to accommodate different budgets, a time tracker should offer a free plan and affordable paid plans, or at least a free trial that allows users to test the app before committing.
Multiplatform availability
— a time tracking tool should allow users to track time across various devices, enabling consistent timekeeping.

Toggl Track
— best for setting and tracking goals
As one of the best apps for time tracking, Toggl Track allows users to easily keep tabs on their work hours, gain insights for better time management, and optimize productivity.
How does Toggl Track work?
To start tracking time with Toggl Track, I select the
Timer
option, enter my task’s name, and click the play button. To finish recording time, I click the stop button.
Timer in Toggl Track
Once I stop the timer, my time entry is automatically saved in the app — no additional steps needed.
Besides checking my time logs via the list or timesheet view in Toggl Track, I can also see my time entries in a calendar format, which I found useful. This option allows me to see what I did the whole week at a glance, helping me identify any gaps or overlaps in my logged time.
To access the calendar view in Toggl Track, click on the
Calendar
tab on the
Timer
page.
Toggl Track’s calendar view
While helpful for visualizing time entries, Toggl Track’s calendar view lacks certain functions, like the option to delete all entries for a given day in one action. This option would enable a quick clean-up of accidental or incorrect time entries, saving you time.
To add a time entry in Toggl Track’s calendar view, I need to click anywhere on the calendar, and a pop-up will appear where I can add time entry details.
Adding a time entry in Toggl Track’s calendar view
After I enter what I’m working on, select the project, and specify start and end times, I just click the
Add
button, and my entry appears on the calendar.
Toggl Track offers a flexible array of time recording options, making it adaptable for various workflows.
Why is Toggl Track best for setting and tracking goals?
Toggl Track allows me to set time-based targets and track my progress towards achieving them. This helps me
avoid distractions from less important tasks
and focus on my priorities (e.g., a specific project).
To set a goal in Toggl Track, I need to:
Access
the
Goals
feature in the sidebar,
Click
the
+ New goal
button,
Name
my goal (e.g.,
Track 3 hours every day on the key project
),
Select
the appropriate project (in this case,
E-commerce website
),
Set
the target hours (in this case,
at least 3 hours every day
),
Specify
the end date (in this case,
08/29/2025
), and
Click
the
Create goal
button.
Creating a goal with Toggl Track
This feature comes in handy for those who need goals or KPIs to keep their work in check, especially project managers.
Once I start working on my goal, I can monitor my progress by entering the

1.75/3 hours
), as shown below:

#3:
Harvest
— best for basic expense tracking
Harvest is an excellent time tracking app for personal use — but it’s also suitable for teams aiming to stay on budget and simplify the invoicing process.
How does Harvest work?
With Harvest, I can track time by manually entering the time spent on my task once I’ve completed it. To do this, I need to:
Navigate
to the
Timesheet
section (accessible under the
Time
menu),
Click
the green
Track time
button,
Select
the project and task,
Enter
my work hours (e.g.,
7:30
), and
Select
the
Save entry
option.
Adding a note is optional.
Manual entry option in Harvest
I can also delete or edit my time entry in Harvest. To edit my time entry, I click on the
Edit
option on the
Timesheet
page, modify the time, date, project, or task associated with that entry, and click the
Update entry
button.
Editing a time entry in Harvest
The only thing I found lacking is the ability to change the billable status of a time entry directly within the log. For instance, to mark your task as billable or non-billable in Harvest, you need to take several actions (go to
Projects
, select a project, click the
Edit project
option, and then adjust the billability status of a specific task), which is time-consuming.
Try a simple Harvest alternative
If we ignore minor practicality issues, Harvest has proven to be a solid timekeeping solution, offering simple time recording options.
Why is Harvest best for basic expense tracking?
With Harvest’s expense tracking feature, I can:
Track project-related expenses,
Mark them as billable or non-billable, and
Choose different expense categories (such as transportation, mileage, lodging, and others).
To create an expense in Harvest, I navigate to the
Expenses
section and click on the
+ Track expenses
button. Then, I need to:
Choose
a project,
Select
a category,
Enter
the date and the amount,
Mark
the expense as billable if I want to bill my client for it, and
Click
the
Save expense
button.
Attaching a receipt to the expense is optional.
Creating expenses with Harvest
I can also edit my expenses, submit them for approval, or delete them. Note that in Harvest, once you submit your expenses for the week, you’re submitting both time and expenses for that week (you can’t submit just the expenses or the time entries for a specific week).
I like that I can attach receipts to my expenses in Harvest. This option allows me to keep all the cost-related information organized and provide transparency to my clients, fostering trust.
🎓
Smart Ways for Monthly Expense Tracking
What additional features does Harvest have?
Harvest offers useful timesheet reminders I can set for my team to ensure the timely submission of timesheets. The app provides several types of reminders, including:
Recurring timesheet reminders
I can send to the entire team, and
One-time timesheet reminders
I can send to specific team members.
As a manager, you can also set recurring timesheet reminders for yourself to stay accountable.
Apart from all that, Harvest also allows me to:
Get
visual reports of my performance and project progress,
Edit
and approve timesheets,
Create
and send invoices, and
Look
into my profitability analysis.
Although Harvest integrates with many accounting and project management tools, it lacks direct payroll integrations. This may be a limitation for businesses that want to streamline payroll processes and save time and money.

How easy is it to use Harvest?
I found the app’s interface a bit difficult to navigate at first.
Specifically, it took me some time to locate the option to start a timer in Harvest, since it wasn’t as clearly visible as I expected it to be. I had to access the
Timesheet
section, click the
Track time
button, and only then could I see the
Start timer
option.
Aside from this minor inconvenience, I didn’t encounter any problems while using Harvest, and I got used to the app quickly.

Harvest pros
To see some of the key advantages of using Harvest, check out the following list:
It allows you to take a picture of a receipt and attach it to an expense through the mobile app, allowing you to manage expenses efficiently, and
It offers the option to attach a time report or additional project information to an invoice before sending it to a client.
Harvest cons
Here are the biggest downsides of using Harvest:
Unlimited seats and projects are only available in paid plans, compared to Clockify, where you can invite as many users and create as many projects as you want in the free plan, and
It doesn’t provide absence or offline tracking capabilities.
What’s new in Harvest?
In June 2025, Harvest updated its
profitability report
. The
Team
and
Tasks
sections now show the cost, profit, and revenue associated with each team and task, allowing users to get deeper insights into their business profitability.

Hubstaff
— best for tracking locations
Being one of the best time tracking apps for work, Hubstaff is go-to software for busy managers looking for a way to keep track of their employees’ productivity levels.
How does Hubstaff work?
To record time via Hubstaff’s timer, I need to choose a project I’m working on and click the play button to turn the timer on. Once I finish working, I stop the timer by clicking the stop button, and my time entry is automatically saved in the app.
Tracking time via Hubstaff’s timer
After my team members and I finish tracking time spent on tasks, I can open the daily view in Hubstaff and see all the relevant details concerning each time entry, including:
Project and task name,
Activity,
Idle time,
Duration, and
Start and end times.
I can also see if time was tracked manually and the reason why it was recorded that way (e.g.,
Forgot to start/stop timer
).
Checking time entries via Hubstaff’s daily view
When I want to edit or add time in Hubstaff, the app requires me to provide a reason for a manual change before saving the entry, which feels unnecessary.
Try an intuitive time tracker
All in all, Hubstaff offers practical timekeeping functionalities, making the process of tracking time efficient.
Why is Hubstaff best for tracking locations?
Hubstaff lets me monitor employee locations and increase time tracking accuracy with GPS time tracking.
To track my team members’ locations with Hubstaff, I have to add job sites in the app. To create a job site in Hubstaff, I need to:
Navigate
to the
Locations
menu in the sidebar,
Select
the
Job sites
option, and
Click
the
Add job site
button.
Click on ‘Add job site’ to create a job site in Hubstaff
Then, I need to enter a job site’s name, address, and define the desired radius (time tracking is triggered when team members enter or leave the designated area). To continue with configuration and save a job site, I click the
Next
button.
Click the ‘Next’ button to finish the job site creation
After clicking
Next
, I select team members and adjust automatic timer actions to start/stop the timer when they enter/leave the site for precise tracking. Finally, I click the
Save
button to save my job site.
Configuring new job site settings in Hubstaff
It looks like a long string of actions, but to my taste it’s actually relatively easy to get a handle on.
Once I create job sites and my team members start recording time via the mobile app, I can see where my employees are when tracking time by using the
Map
functionality. The
Map
option is located under the
Locations
menu.
Checking employee locations with Hubstaff
Tracking employee locations with Hubstaff offers several benefits, including improved accountability, more
effective resource planning
, and enhanced safety for field teams.
What additional features does Hubstaff have?
Along with tracking locations and creating in-depth time reports, Hubstaff lets me:
Review
and approve timesheets,
Look
into all the apps used while the timer was on,
Review
and approve time off,
Take
a look at screenshots to see how time is spent,
Send
automatic payments based on the time tracked, and
Create
invoices.
Hubstaff also comes with 30+ integrations, but streamlining your workflow with them has a hefty price tag attached.
If you’re interested in integrating Hubstaff with even just one of the offered apps, you’ll be able to do it only after upgrading to the Grow plan ($7.50/seat/month).
In case you’re in for the unlimited number of integrations, you’ll have to upgrade further to an even pricier option.
How easy is it to use Hubstaff?
Hubstaff comes off as less intuitive and clear-cut compared to some of its competitors. For instance, it took me a while to get a gist of the dashboard, due to the overwhelming number of functionalities available.
Moreover, setting up Hubstaff requires a certain amount of time — which means a longer learning curve.

As one of the best time tracking apps for productivity, Time Doctor gained its reputation for enabling its users to monitor their workflow in great detail.

Select

Click
the green check mark button to save a time entry.
Apart from that, adding a reason is optional.
Adding time manually with Time Doctor
In Time Doctor, I can open my dashboard and see my tracked time for:
Today,
Yesterday,
Past 7 days, or
Past 30 days.
This is what it looks like when I choose to view my time logs for the past 7 days:
Time Doctor’s user dashboard
Note that Time Doctor offers 2 types of dashboards — a user and team dashboard. A user dashboard helps individual employees track their work, while a team dashboard lets managers monitor their team’s performance. As a manager, you can easily switch between these 2 dashboards by clicking on the
Dashboard
menu.
Switching between user and team dashboards in Time Doctor
Time Doctor provides live visibility into how time is spent and simplifies employee timekeeping. This allows for improved efficiency and more effective resource allocation.
Why is Time Doctor best for tracking and analyzing performance?

How easy is it to use Time Doctor?
Compared to some other time tracking apps, I found Time Doctor a bit complicated to navigate at first. Specifically, it took me some time to find the option to add time manually (I had to access the

Adding time manually in Everhour
What’s interesting about Everhour is that it also lets you track time without adding a task or project. In other words, I can quickly start a timer (e.g., if I have an urgent bug to work on) and allocate time to the right task later, which I found convenient.
Everhour provides useful time tracking functionalities, including an auto-stop timer option and handy reminders, allowing for precise timekeeping.
Why is Everhour best for task planning?
Everhour lets me create and plan assignments for my team members more easily than ever. To schedule tasks in Everhour, I go to the
Resource Planner
section in the sidebar and click the green plus sign button.

After that, I do the following:
Choose the assignment type (
Project or Task
,
Client
, or
Time off
),
Specify a task and a member,
Select a period,
Enter the estimated number of hours for the assignment per day, and
Click the Save button to finish assignment creation.
Apart from that, adding a note is optional.
Creating assignments with Everhour
After I finish planning work for my team and me, I can see all the assignments on a timeline. To quickly view the details of each assignment, I just hover over a specific task, as shown below:
Hover over the assignment in Everhour for more details
This way, I can also see how much time my team members have tracked for their tasks and check their progress (e.g., 3h of 21h).
I like that Everhour gives me the option to assign different colors to assignments. This allows me to easily distinguish tasks on a timeline and identify specific assignments at a glance.
What additional features does Everhour have?
Being a comprehensive tool with both basic and advanced time tracking features, Everhour is a good choice if you want to:
Mark
billable hours,
Get
reminders to track time,

projects down into smaller tasks,

into your team’s attendance,

My Hours
— best for creating task templates
Being one of the best time tracking apps for freelancers and small teams, My Hours has almost everything you need for efficient time tracking and work organization.
How does My Hours work?
Once I create my account, I can track time in My Hours by entering work hours manually. To do so, I need to:
Go
to the
Track
page,
Select
a project I’m working on,
Choose
a task (optional), and
Enter
my work hours in the appropriate time slot.
My first impression was that this page looked outdated and clunky, especially with all the gray.
Entering time manually in My Hours
To edit my time log, I need to click on the pen icon within a time slot field. Then, I can:
Change the project or task related to that entry,
Add description or tags,
Adjust start and end times, or
Change the entry’s billable status.
To apply the changes, I simply click the
Save
button.
Editing a time log in My Hours
As one of the best free time tracking apps for employees, My Hours gives users flexibility in how they track their time by offering several time recording options. However, the app lacks offline tracking capabilities, which is a bit disappointing.

Why is My Hours best for creating task templates?
Instead of recreating the same tasks for each new project, with My Hours, I can apply a pre-built template and save time.
To create a task template in My Hours, I need to:
Go
to the
Settings
menu in the sidebar,
Select
the
Task templates
option, and
Click
the
+ New Task template
button.
Creating a new task template
Then, I need to name my task template and enter a description or billable rate. I can also check the
Billable by default
box. This way, the task from this template will always be added to projects as billable.
After entering all the relevant details, I save a template by clicking the
Save
button.
Creating a task template with My Hours
In My Hours, all task templates with the same task list name are automatically grouped in the same task list. And when I add a template to a project, I add a task list, not individual tasks. I found this convenient, as it allows me to add several tasks at once and set up my project faster.
To add a task list template to a project in My Hours, I have to:
Select the
Projects
section from the sidebar,
Choose a project (in my case,
Sample Project
), and
Click on the
Tasks
tab.
Overview of the project in My Hours
After that, I click on the
+ Task list templates
menu and choose a template I want to use (in this case,
Social media
).

As soon as I click on
Add tasks
, the template is automatically applied, which I found helpful for my workflow.
