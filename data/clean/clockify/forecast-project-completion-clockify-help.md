Forecasting helps you visualize your project’s progress based on tracked time. See how you’ve performed on recurring projects for a set time period and make predictions based on scheduled assignments and add estimates or budget to see if the project will go over or under them.
Forecasting is a paid feature, available to admins only. You can enable it by
upgrading
your workspace to Pro or Enterprise plan.
User interface displayed in this video may not correspond to the latest version of the app.
