Time tracking software for construction companies
With all the dynamics, confusion, and constant action that happens on the field, it's practically a constant that a worker will forget to input his daily hours in the timesheet. Well, Clockify takes care of that problem — a single click at the start of the day is sufficient to get all the data you need.
Super simple way to track work hours
Your employees can track time using a timer app, or enter how much they've worked in an online timesheet.
See who works on what
Reports break down all the tracked time and group it by project, employee, or any other dimension. Set your cost codes as tasks, tags, or custom fields, and filter out reports to see the labor cost for each cost code.
You can also export data in PDF, CSV, and Excel.
Monitor progress
Create tasks and assign people to them so they can track time against them. Estimate how long each task should take and visually check progress. If a project goes over budget, Clockify can send you an alert.
If you're working on a project and it goes over budget, you can specify the limits in Clockify's settings and let it alert you.
