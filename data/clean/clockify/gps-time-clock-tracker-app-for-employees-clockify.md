What is Clockify? (11:05)
A time tracking app — Clockify
Clockify is
a time tracker
that gives you full reports on your daily and weekly tasks by tracking the time it takes for you to finish them. It's simple to use:
Begin your day by starting the timer
Specify your tasks for the day
Let the app run in the background
You can grant Clockify access to track idleness,
activity
across web and apps, and let it remind you to clock in your time.
GPS tracking
Aside from tracking time, Clockify can also access your location (with your permission) and let your workspace members know where you are. The location is a part of the tracker function — meaning you'll be able to share your location when you're tracking time.
This can be useful for a number of things, such as letting the workplace administrator know if employees are on the field or where their last-tracked location was.
