Time tracking for attorneys and lawyers
Track billable and non-billable time
Lawyers and attorneys can track time using a timer, or enter how much they've worked manually in timesheets. Bill clients for every work minute by making sure you log every call, e-mail, and meeting.
Monitor budget
Estimate how long each legal task should take, track time against them, and visually check progress. If a project or client goes over budget, Clockify can send you an alert.
Track client profitability
Reports break down all the tracked time by client. You can round time up to minimum billable increment, see how much of time is billable vs nonbillable, how much you've earned, and download data for invoicing.

Clockify has everything we need, without costing a fortune
We used to spend $2,000 each month on a time tracker just so everyone could log their time. That was too much. So, we created Clockify. It has everything teams and companies really need, without costing a fortune
