What is Clockify? (11:05)
Field Management App — Clockify
Clockify is a
time tracker
that gives you full reports on your daily and weekly tasks by tracking the time it takes for you to finish them.
Aside from tracking time, Clockify can also access your location (with your permission) and let your workspace field manager know where you are. The location is a part of the tracker function — meaning you'll be able to share your location when you're tracking time.
This can be useful for a number of things, such as managing field workers who visit client sites and seeing where people's last-tracked location was.
