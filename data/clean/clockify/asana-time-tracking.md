How to track time in Asana
Start timer inside Asana
Clockify timer button will automatically appear in all Asana tasks.
(Note: If you don't see the button, click on the extension to open it and make sure you're logged-in.)
Timer starts ticking
Clockify will pick up Asana's task name and project, and the timer will start ticking. You can stop the timer from anywhere (browser, mobile, or desktop).
Project sync
If there's a project in Clockify that matches the Asana project, the extension will automatically select the project.
Extension can also create and pick up projects, tasks, and tags in Clockify based on information in Asana. You can enable this in the extension's Settings.
Run time reports and manage projects
In the web version, you can edit past entries, analyze time, manage projects, invite people, review timesheets, and export reports.
