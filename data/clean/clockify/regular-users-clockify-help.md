All invited users are categorized as
Regular users
by default. They have various permissions and can perform certain actions, including time tracking, project creation, and personal dashboards.
Please note that CAKE.com permissions also apply, as CAKE.com operates as the central organization. For more details on CAKE.com permissions and how they affect individual products, please refer to
this article
.
Regular users can become Admins or Team managers after being promoted by existing Admins and Project managers*  (*if Project managers have those rights on a project).
