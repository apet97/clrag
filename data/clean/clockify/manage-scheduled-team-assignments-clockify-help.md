Track cost and billability per user
#
Team tab allows you to track costs and billable amounts per user alongside scheduled projects and tasks.
To view cost amounts and billability for a project or task, make sure both cost rate and
billable hours
are enabled in the Workspace settings. If either is disabled, you won’t see this information on the
Scheduling
page.
To enable
billabile hours
on a workspace:
Open
Workspace settings
Switch to the
Permissions
tab
In the
Billable hours
section, enable
Activate billable hours
To enable
cost rate
on a workspace:
Open
Workspace settings
In the
General
tab,
Cost and profit analysis
section, enable
Activate cost rate
Additionally, a Workspace
cost rate
field will appear, allowing you to set the default cost rate for each tracked hour in your workspace.
Optionally, set additional permissions regarding who can view hourly rates, amounts, and the billable status of entries.
To enable
cost rate
and
billability
on
Schedule
page:
Open
Workspace settings
In the
General
tab, under the
Scheduling
section, enable
See billable cost and amount
To see total billable and cost amount per user:
Check the Amount/Cost column for totals
Expand users to see more details on scheduled projects/tasks
Collapsed view
Assigned hours: Total hours assigned to each user
Amount/Cost: Total cost data for each user, similar to the
Projects tab
Expanded view
When expanded, the Amount/Cost column shows financial data for each project. If a user has multiple projects in different currencies, the default currency is shown first, followed by others in alphabetical order. Hovering over the notation reveals all amounts.
Daily and weekly capacity
#
Use the Daily capacity option to see if users are under, over, or at full capacity for that day. Hovering shows Amount and Cost rates. This applies to the Weekly view as well, just on a weekly level.
Amount and cost values are displayed in the number and currency format set up in the Workspace settings.
If you downgrade your subscription plan or disable billability, Amount and Cost data won’t appear the timeline.
