Stay on top of your income for accurate budgeting
Budgeting templates are a perfect all-in-one tool for:
Making spending estimates,
Setting attainable financial goals, and
Obtaining a clear rundown of all your expenses over time.
However, making accurate income estimates and crafting an error-free financial plan might not always be doable — especially if your salary varies month in and month out.
On top of that, if you're just now dipping your toes into budgeting, you might also frequently need to review and change your plan along the way. Apart from being a massive time waster, this could also potentially decrease your motivation to continue keeping a close eye on your budget.
To make sure you have the most accurate numbers at hand, even before plotting a financial plan, you'll need to know the exact number of hours you've worked. This is where a
work hours tracker
can help you get going.
If you use Clockify to track your work hours, you'll be able to see exactly how much you've earned by
activating billable rates
and tracking your project progress in real-time.
Setting billable hours in Clockify is a matter of seconds.
Also, if you are a freelancer who bills by project, you could greatly benefit from Clockify's

, which gives you the option to:
Estimate your project budget,
Track project status, and
