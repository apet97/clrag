How to track time in Basecamp
Step 3
Start timer inside Basecamp
Clockify timer button will automatically appear in all Basecamp to-dos.
Step 4
Timer starts ticking
Clockify will pick up Basecamp's to-do name and the timer will start ticking. You can stop the timer from anywhere (browser, mobile, or desktop).
Step 5
Sync projects
If there's a project in Clockify that matches the Basecamp project, the extension will automatically select the project when you start tracking time so you don't have to do it manually.
Step 6
Run time reports and manage projects
In the web version, you can edit past entries, analyze time, manage projects, invite people, review timesheets, and export reports.
