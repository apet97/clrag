Categorize time using required fields & tags
5 min read
Required fields
#
Required fields
are the minimum fields that must be completed before a time entry can be created.
Use required fields to prevent incomplete time entries, so that all entries have essential data like project, task, tag, and description and improve the accuracy and consistency of your reports.
Required fields can be created on workspaces that are on all paid plans.
To use required fiends as a Team manager or Project manager, you’ll need your Admin to enable this feature in the Workspace settings.
How required fields work
#
Once required fields are enabled, certain fields must be filled out before time entries can be saved or tracked.
For example:
If
project
and
tag
are marked as required, users cannot submit a time entry without selecting a project and tag. Also, the timer cannot be stopped until a project and tag are assigned. Even if the task field is optional, the project and tag fields will be mandatory.
If a task is required, only projects with tasks will appear in the project picker. If no tasks exist for a project, that project will not be selectable for time tracking.
Important to note
:
Only
admins
can set up and change required fields in the
Workspace settings
If a required field is missing, the system will prompt the user to complete the missing information before the time entry is finalized
Tags
#
Tags
are a powerful tool for categorizing time entries. By associating tags with time entries, you can easily filter and report on various types of work.
Use tags to group time entries by specific tasks, clients, project types, or any other criteria relevant to your workflow. Tags make it easier to generate detailed reports and analyze where time is being spent across projects or teams.
How tags work
#
Tags are
mandatory
when required fields are enabled, ensuring all time entries are categorized appropriately. You can use existing tags, or create new ones when entering time.
Create tags
#
Go to Tags page from sidebar
Type tag name and click ADD
Or:
Click tag icon on a time entry
Start typing tag name
Click Create tag or press Ctrl/^(Control)+Enter
All deleted tags will be removed from time entries they are assigned to.
Manage tags
#
You can set up
custom tags
based on your project needs
Tags can be
assigned to projects, tasks, and time entries
, providing flexibility in how you track and report time.
Tips for effectively using required fields & tags
#
Make
sure all team members use consistent tags for easy reporting and analysis
Create a tag system (e.g. Client A > Research > Development) to keep entries organized
Regularly review which fields should be marked as required to adjust it to your team’s evolving needs
FAQ
#
Can I set required fields for individual projects or tasks?
#
No, required fields are set at the
workspace level
and apply to
all time entries
across the workspace. This means you cannot designate different required fields for individual projects or tasks. For instance, if you mark the
Project
and
Tag
fields as required, then every user across all projects in the workspace will need to provide a project and a tag when logging time, regardless of the specific project or task. However, you can customize the required fields for your workspace as a whole by choosing which field (e.g.
Project
,
Task
,
Tag
, or
Description)
are mandatory for time entries.
Can I disable required fields after enabling them?
#
Yes, you can modify the required fields at any time, but only
admins
have the permissions to do so. If you decide that certain fields no longer need to be mandatory (e.g. you no longer want the
Description
field to be required), you can go into the
Workspace settings
and disable that field. However, keep in mind that any changes made to the required fields will apply to
all future time entries
, and any time entries that were already submitted (even with missing information) will remain as they are.
Can I use tags for more detailed reporting?
#
Absolutely! Tags are a powerful tool for
categorizing
and
filtering
your time entries. By using tags consistently across your workspace, you can easily generate reports based on the tags you’ve assigned. For example, if you use tags for different project phases (e.g. Planning, Development, and Testing), you can filter your time entries to see how much time was spent in each phase. Similarly, tags can be used to differentiate between clients, types of work (e.g. Billable, Internal), or other relevant categories.
Can required fields be applied to time entries logged via the mobile app or browser extension?
#
Yes, the
required fields
settings apply to time entries made across all platforms, including the
mobile app
and
browser extension
. If you attempt to log time via any device and the required fields (like
Project
or
Tag
) are not completed, you will be prompted to fill in the missing information before you can save the entry.
How do required fields impact existing time entries?
#
Required fields only affect new or updated time entries after they are enabled. If the required fields are set up in the middle of a project, time entries that have already been logged will not retroactively require the fields. However, from the moment the required fields are activated, any
new time entries
or
updates to existing entries
will need to meet the new requirements. This ensures that moving forward, all data logged is complete and organized.
Can I customize which users are affected by required fields?
#
No, required fields apply to all users in the workspace once enabled, regardless of their role (e.g. Admin, Project Manager, Team Member).
For additional assistance or to configure required fields and tags according to your workspace’s specific needs, you can always reach out to your
Workspace admin
or consult our
Help Center
for detailed instructions and best practices.
