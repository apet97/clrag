Approve team’s time entries
8 min read
As a Team or Project manager, you play a crucial role in ensuring that your team’s time entries are accurately tracked, reviewed, and approved. This guide will walk you through the process of managing time entry approvals, ensuring that time and budget allocations for projects are accurate and well-documented.
What is time entry approval?
#
Approving time entries is the process where
Admins
,
Project managers
, or
Team managers
review and approve or reject time entries submitted by team members. The goal is to ensure that time spent on projects is correctly tracked, budgeted, and allocated for accurate reporting and invoicing.
Time approvals are available on Standard and higher subscription plans. The ability to approve expenses requires a Pro or higher plan.
Roles and permissions
#
In your workspace, the ability to approve time and expenses is determined by your role and the permissions.
Team managers
(if enabled): Can approve time entries and expenses for users they manage.
Project managers
(if enabled): Can approve time entries for team members working on the projects they manage.
Admin
can modify these permissions by navigating to the
Workspace Settings > Permissions
tab and configuring the
Who can approve submitted timesheets and expenses
section.
