Why replace Connecteam with Clockify
Schedule employees with ease
Clockify lets you create schedules easily. Start with adding projects and tasks, see your team’s availability, visualize shifts based on employees’ capacity, and save schedule templates.
Team management and communication
You can use Clockify to upload company policies, request and approve time-off requests, and manage vacation days for your employees.
Clockify offers you a free team communication and collaboration tool - Pumble. With Pumble you can send direct or group messages in private or public channels, use emojis and reactions, share files, make calls, and more.
Time tracking on a mobile, kiosk, desktop, web
Whether your employees track time manually via timesheets or use a time clock to mark the start and the end of a shift, all changes will be synced across devices (mobile, web, or desktop).
Use a mobile app to track time from your pocket for on-field tasks. When GPS tracking is used, you can monitor who is on-site and view their location history over the day.
Productivity targets, reminders & reports
Set time tracking targets, and compare estimated vs actual time you spend on activities. Clockify allows you to set project estimates and budget to see how much progress you made and how much money is spent.
To manage your payroll process quicker, apply different hourly rates to your billable time entries and see how much you earned in reports. Reports can be extracted in PDF, Excel or CSV format, and they can contain all the information you choose to include.
