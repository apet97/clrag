Profile editing is a paid feature available to Owners and Admins by
upgrading
the workspace to any of the paid plans.
To edit user’s profile:
Go to the
Team
page
Click on the three dots next to the user’s name
Select
Edit profile
Make the changes (week start*, capacity, working days, entering user’s ID or setting the type of employment to part-time)
Save changes
Important notes:
Users can only edit their
email
,
profile picture
and
username
themselves on their
CAKE.com Account
page
Any changes made to the
week start
or
working days
are emailed to the user after being saved
Week start*
cannot be changed if there are pending approvals
If you have custom
user fields
(e.g. employee ID, department), you can edit these directly in the profile

set up on the
Team
page overrides the default one in the
Workspace settings

User belongs to more than one workspace
User’s account is inactive

User is assigned the Owner role
Daily capacity
