Approve entries & time off requests for Workspace members
9 min read
As a Workspace Admin or Owner, managing time entries and time off requests is crucial to make sure that team members’ time is accurately tracked, and that planned absences are accounted for. This guide will walk you through the process of approving time entries and time off requests, including how to edit, reject, and send reminders.
Key concepts
#
Time entries
: Hours tracked by team members for their work on various projects or tasks
Time off requests
: Requests submitted by employees to take time off, such as vacation or sick leave
Approval workflow
: The process by which you review and either approve or reject time entries and time off requests
Access permissions
#
Workspace Admins and Owners
can approve, reject, and edit time entries and time off requests for all team members
Team managers
(if enabled) can approve, reject, and edit the time entries and requests for users they manage
Project managers
(if enabled) can approve or reject time entries and time off requests for team members working on their assigned projects
Configure approval permissions
#
To configure approval permissions for your workspace:
Navigate to
Workspace settings
>
Permissions
tab
In the
Who can approve submitted timesheets and expenses
section, choose:
Admins & Team managers
: Team members can approve time entries for users they manage
Admins & Project managers
: Project managers can approve time entries for users on their assigned projects
If a user has both Admin and Manager roles, the Admin role will override the other roles. For example, an Admin who is also a Team Manager will have the permissions of both roles.
Approve time entries
#
To approve or reject time entries:
Go to the
Approvals
page in your dashboard
In the
Pending tab
, you’ll see time entries waiting for approval. Each entry will show the
author
,
time
, and
status
(e.g. pending, approved, rejected)
Review time entries
#
Each time entry will include:
User name
: Team member who submitted time
Project and task
: Project or task to which the time is assigned
Logged time
: Number of hours worked
Description
: Notes or description provided by the team member
You can filter the entries by user, group, or date range to make it easier to review.
Approve or reject time entries
#
Approve time entry
: If everything looks good, click the
Approve
button. The entry will be marked as approved and locked.
Reject time entry
: If there are issues with the entry (e.g. incorrect hours), click
Reject
. A prompt will ask you to leave a rejection note. The user will be notified of the rejection via email.
Bulk approve or reject time entries
#
To approve or reject multiple time entries at once:
Select the checkboxes
next to the entries you wish to approve or reject
Click the
Approve
or
Reject
button at the top of the page to apply your action to all selected entries
Edit pending time entries
#
Admins can edit any user’s pending time entries directly. Team managers can only edit pending time entries for their team members.
To edit a pending time entry:
Go to the
Pending
tab on the
Approvals
page
Click on the
edit pen icon
next to the time entry
In the
Edit time entry
screen, make the necessary changes:
Adjust
time and date
Edit the
description
or
project/task
Change the
billability
status
After making the necessary changes, click
Save
to finalize the change.
Approval notifications
#
The
user
will receive an email notification when their time entry is approved
The
manager
will be notified when a time entry is submitted for approval
Admins
will be notified when a user submits their timesheet (if they have the necessary Manager role for that user)
Approve time off requests
#
Time off requests can be approved through the
Requests tab
under the
Time Off
page.
Filter
requests by
status
(pending, approved, rejected), by
group
or a specific
team member
or by a
time range
.
Each request will show:
Team member
: The employee requesting time off
Period
: The start and end dates of the requested time off
Requested time
: Number of requested days/hours
Policy
: Policy under which the request has been submitted
Status
: Pending, approved, or rejected
When you request a time off, the app checks your available balance. If you have insufficient leave, the request will appear in red and cannot be approved until the balance is adjusted.
If negative balance is enabled, Clockify will display the number of negative days or hours allowed. If the request exceeds this limit, you won’t be able to submit it.
Approve or reject time off requests
#
To approve or reject a time off request:
Go to the
Time off
page
Find/filter out pending time off request in the
Requests
tab
Click
Approve
or choose

from the three-dots menu
If you reject the request, leave a
note
to explain the reason
The user will receive an email notification if their request is approved or rejected
Or open the email you received after the request has been submitted and approve/reject.
Reject previously approved time off requests
#
If you need to reject a previously approved request (e.g. due to a scheduling conflict), you can do so by:
Find/filter out the request in the
Requests
tab
Click
Reject
and leave a rejection note
The user will be notified of the rejection via email.
View time off in timeline
#
To get a quick overview of upcoming time off for your team, use the Timeline view:
Go to the
Time off

Timeline
tab
The timeline shows a
30-day
view of all upcoming leaves, with each entry marked by the color of its time off policy.
You can customize the colors for approved, pending, and holiday time off.
Manage Team and Project manager roles
#
As an Admin, you can assign
Team manager
or
Project manager
roles to team members, allowing them to approve time entries and time off requests for their team or project members.
To assign a manager role:
Go to the
Team
page
Find the user you wish to assign a manager role to and click
+ Role
Select
Team manager
or
Project manager
For Team managers, select the
users/groups
they will be responsible for

they will manage
Click
Save
to confirm the role assignment.
Once a user has a manager role, they will have access to the
Approvals page
to manage timesheets and time off requests for their assigned team or project.
Send reminders to approve time entries
#
As an Admin, you can send reminders to Team or Project managers who have pending time entries to approve.
To send reminders:
Go to the
Approvals
page

What should I do if a user claims they submitted a time entry, but I can’t find it?

Check if the user might have submitted their time in a
different workspace
. Each user has their own personal workspace, and sometimes they may accidentally track time there instead of the correct workspace. As an Admin, you can check their personal workspace to see if the time was logged there.

Yes, you can customize the colors for approved, pending, and holiday time off:
Go to the
Time off
policy settings

What happens if I reject a time entry by mistake?
#
If you accidentally reject a time entry, you can ask the user to resubmit it. Alternatively, as an Admin, you can manually edit the time entry and approve it again.
