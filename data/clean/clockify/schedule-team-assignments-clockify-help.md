Schedule team assignments
3 min read
Scheduling team assignments helps you plan projects easily by providing a visual timeline of your team’s availability. This way, you can easily see who’s working on a project/task.
Scheduling is a paid feature, which you can enable by
upgrading
your workspace to the PRO or ENTERPRISE plan.

Navigate team capacity with Team view
#
Team view provides a quick overview of your team’s capacity, indicating who’s available and who’s overbooked. Project and team views use the same assignment data, allowing you to plan and organize work more efficiently.
If they have permissions to create assignments, Regular users and Team managers only have a
Team
view on the
Schedule
page.
