Export invoices
2 min read
If you’d like to have all the invoices related to, for example, a certain client, or date all in one place stored and saved, you can export them as CSV or Excel files.
Exporting invoices is available on Trial, Standard and all higher subscription plans.
Admins and Specific users/user groups
selected in the
Who can manage invoices
section can use this feature if enabled in the
Workspace settings
.
To export invoices:
Go to
Invoices
Click
Export
at the top right corner of the screen
Choose one of the following options:
Save as CSV
Save as Excel
Customize…
Export to Excel or CSV
#
Exported is named in the following way: Clockify_Invoices_<issue date>.
Invoices exported as Excel or CSV files list all the invoices based on the applied filters, and contain all the relevant information such as
invoice ID
,
client
,
issue date
,
amount
,
balance
,
currency
and the
invoice status
. If there are multiple pages, they are all exported within the same file.
The
Balance
info is related to the
Partially paid status
we have for invoices.
Instead of having a separate
Currency
column, exporting invoices with multiple currencies is handled in the same way as exporting time entries/expenses with multiple currencies.

To export only specific data related to your invoices, you can customize your invoice export settings.
This way, you can export all the invoices in the table with the chosen filters applied to the CSV and Excel tables, similarly to how invoice tables are displayed in Clockify.
To customize invoice export:
Click
Customize
It opens
Invoice export settings
with information about
Invoices
mentioned above
Choose data you’d like to be exported by checking or unchecking the boxes (all boxes are checked by default)
After you update and save the settings, these changes are applied to all future exports. Export settings are individual for each user.
