Freelance time tracking and invoicing
Aside from helping you create invoices with accurate billable hours and information, Clockify can also produce:

- Assign hourly rates by project
- Track project status using estimates
How time tracking for freelancers work
Even though Clockify is a time tracker, it can be argued that it's a multifunctional app — meaning it can operate as a task/project management app with a hint of accounting in its system.
But, to find out more, you'll have to figure out how it works — here are some quick steps to get the hang of it.
Create an account
Enter your email, choose a password, and create an account for free — it's that easy.
Set up projects
Create projects, categorize them by clients, and create tasks on projects. Then, all you have to do is choose a project/task, write an optional description of what you're doing, and start the timer.
Track time
Track the time you spend on activities across apps and webs with a single-click timer. If you forget to start the timer, you can always enter the time manually later.
You can track time in the browser, or via desktop and mobile app (iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Linux). The desktop app can help you track time more efficiently with reminders, idle detection, and more.
Track time inside other apps
Install Chrome, Firefox or Edge extensions and a timer button will appear in your favorite web apps so you can track time more easily (Trello, Asana, Todoist, etc.).
Set hourly rates
Set hourly rates for each employee and project. All your team has to do is mark their time entries as billable and Clockify will automatically calculate the billable amount.
Export reports
You can run an online report and break down time tracking data however you need.
When the time comes, export the report as: PDF, CSV, Excel.
Set budget and invoice tracked time
As far as finances are concerned, Clockify lets you:
- Set fixed fee projects (in time or money)
- Choose if you want to reset the tracking results each month
- Create invoices from your billable hours
