Why replace Homebase with Clockify
Free-forever plan
Get started for FREE, with unlimited number of users. Upgrade at any time if you need additional features.
Super simple attendance tracking
Set up a time clock kiosk on any device (phone, computer, tablet), and let employees punch in when their shifts start or end with just one button.
In addition to kiosk mode, you can also allow each employee to log into Clockify and track their time personally via web, mobile, or desktop app.
Create schedules and shifts
Select a custom period, see each member's capacity, assign them to projects and tasks during specific hours in a day, add notes, or make adjustments to a schedule with dragging & dropping.
Manage teams and track their activity
Assign roles to team members and see who's currently clocked in and where. You can also see what they worked on, what their week looked like, and clock in for them.
In Clockify, you can share company policies with employees, request and approve time off, and manage vacations and sick leaves.
Export reports
Create reports to see who worked when and how much, with hourly rates added, and export them as PDF, Excel, or CSV files. Reports can also be shared with others and scheduled to be received automatically each day, week, or month.
Team communication and collaboration
Clockify comes with integrated team communication and collaboration tool - Pumble. You can communicate with your team member directly, use public or private group chats, share files, documents, and make calls.
24/7 support
If you're working late hours - we do too. With 24/7 customer support, you can reach out for support on whatever interrupts your flow.
