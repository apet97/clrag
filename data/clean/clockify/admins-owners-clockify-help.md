Clockify has two types of user roles in the
Administrative
category:
Owner
: User who created the workspace
Admin
: User with administrative permissions
Role overview
#
Admin
vs
Owner
:
If the Owner leaves the workspace, the entire workspace is deleted
Admins can appoint users as
Managers
, who have additional project and team management permissions.
Admins have a range of capabilities, including assigning roles, editing subscription payment information, managing groups, inviting users, setting user statuses, defining billable rates, overseeing time entries, scheduling projects and more.
However, admins have some limitations, especially when it comes to managing subscriptions and payment details.

Subscription and payment permissions
#
While admins have many privileges in Clockify,
they do not have full access to subscription or payment-related information
if the workspace has an active subscription.
Specifically:
Admins
can access the
Subscription
page and the
Payment tab
, but they
cannot
edit
Customer information
,
Invoice information
, or
Subscription payment information
Admins
can
see
Customer and Invoice information
, but they
cannot
make any changes to them
Admins have the ability to
add or remove full and limited seats
in the workspace, but
cannot remove bundle seats
or limited seats on a
Bundle plan
Admins can
cancel
or
reactivate
a subscription, and they can
download and pay invoices
Admins can access the
Plans tab
and make decisions to
upgrade
or
downgrade
the workspace plan, but they do not have access to the detailed payment information itself
Only the
Owner
can edit subscription payment details, manage customer information, and perform all other administrative tasks related to billing and payment.
