Feedback is LangSmith’s way of storing the criteria and scores from evaluation on a particular trace or intermediate run (span). Feedback can be produced from a variety of ways, such as:
- Sent up along with a trace from the LLM application
- Generated by a user in the app inline or in an annotation queue
- Generated by an automatic evaluator during offline evaluation
- Generated by an online evaluator
