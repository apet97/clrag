Documentation
LangChain is the platform for agent engineering. AI teams at Replit, Clay, Rippling, Cloudflare, Workday, and more trust LangChain’s products to engineer reliable agents.Our open source frameworks help you build agents:- LangChain helps you quickly get started building agents, with any model provider of your choice.
- LangGraph allows you to control every step of your custom agent with low-level orchestration, memory, and human-in-the-loop support. You can manage long-running tasks with durable execution.
- Observability to see exactly how your agent thinks and acts with detailed tracing and aggregate trend metrics.
- Evaluation to test and score agent behavior on production data and offline datasets for continuous improvement.
- Deployment to ship your agent in one click, using scalable infrastructure built for long-running tasks.
