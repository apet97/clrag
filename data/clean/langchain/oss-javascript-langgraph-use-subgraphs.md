- Building multi-agent systems
- Re-using a set of nodes in multiple graphs
- Distributing development: when you want different teams to work on different parts of the graph independently, you can define each part as a subgraph, and as long as the subgraph interface (the input and output schemas) is respected, the parent graph can be built without knowing any details of the subgraph
- Invoke a graph from a node — subgraphs are called from inside a node in the parent graph
- Add a graph as a node — a subgraph is added directly as a node in the parent and shares state keys with the parent
Setup
Invoke a graph from a node
A simple way to implement a subgraph is to invoke a graph from inside the node of another graph. In this case subgraphs can have completely different schemas from the parent graph (no shared keys). For example, you might want to keep a private message history for each of the agents in a multi-agent system. If that’s the case for your application, you need to define a node function that invokes the subgraph. This function needs to transform the input (parent) state to the subgraph state before invoking the subgraph, and transform the results back to the parent state before returning the state update from the node.Full example: different state schemas

- We’re transforming the state from the child state channels (
myChildKey
) to the grandchild state channels (myGrandchildKey
) - We’re transforming the state from the grandchild state channels (
myGrandchildKey
) back to the child state channels (myChildKey
) - We’re passing a function here instead of just compiled graph (

) - We’re transforming the state from the parent state channels (

Add a graph as a node
When the parent graph and subgraph can communicate over a shared state key (channel) in the schema, you can add a graph as a node in another graph. For example, in multi-agent systems, the agents often communicate over a shared messages key. If your subgraph shares state keys with the parent graph, you can follow these steps to add it to your graph:- Define the subgraph workflow (
subgraphBuilder
in the example below) and compile it - Pass compiled subgraph to the
.addNode
method when defining the parent graph workflow

Add persistence
You only need to provide the checkpointer when compiling the parent graph. LangGraph will automatically propagate the checkpointer to the child subgraphs.View subgraph state
When you enable persistence, you can inspect the graph state (checkpoint) via the appropriate method. To view the subgraph state, you can use the subgraphs option. You can inspect the graph state viagraph.getState(config)
. To view the subgraph state, you can use graph.getState(config, { subgraphs: true })
.

Stream subgraph outputs
To include outputs from subgraphs in the streamed outputs, you can set the subgraphs option in the stream method of the parent graph. This will stream outputs from both the parent graph and any subgraphs.- Set
subgraphs: true
to stream outputs from subgraphs.
