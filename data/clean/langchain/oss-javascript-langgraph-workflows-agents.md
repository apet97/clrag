LangGraph v1.0Welcome to the new LangGraph documentation! If you encounter any issues or have feedback, please open an issue so we can improve. Archived v0 documentation can be found here.See the release notes and migration guide for a complete list of changes and instructions on how to upgrade your code.
- Workflows have predetermined code paths and are designed to operate in a certain order.
- Agents are dynamic and define their own processes and tool usage.
Setup
To build a workflow or agent, you can use any chat model that supports structured outputs and tool calling. The following example uses Anthropic:- Install dependencies
- Initialize the LLM:
LLMs and augmentations
Workflows and agentic systems are based on LLMs and the various augmentations you add to them. Tool calling, structured outputs, and short term memory are a few options for tailoring LLMs to your needs.Prompt chaining
Prompt chaining is when each LLM call processes the output of the previous call. It’s often used for performing well-defined tasks that can be broken down into smaller, verifiable steps. Some examples include:- Translating documents into different languages
- Verifying generated content for consistency
Parallelization
With parallelization, LLMs work simultaneously on a task. This is either done by running multiple independent subtasks at the same time, or running the same task multiple times to check for different outputs. Parallelization is commonly used to:- Split up subtasks and run them in parallel, which increases speed
- Run tasks multiple times to check for different outputs, which increases confidence
- Running one subtask that processes a document for keywords, and a second subtask to check for formatting errors
- Running a task multiple times that scores a document for accuracy based on different criteria, like the number of citations, the number of sources used, and the quality of the sources
Routing
Routing workflows process inputs and then directs them to context-specific tasks. This allows you to define specialized flows for complex tasks. For example, a workflow built to answer product related questions might process the type of question first, and then route the request to specific processes for pricing, refunds, returns, etc.Orchestrator-worker
In an orchestrator-worker configuration, the orchestrator:- Breaks down tasks into subtasks
- Delegates subtasks to workers
- Synthesizes worker outputs into a final result
Creating workers in LangGraph
Orchestrator-worker workflows are common and LangGraph has built-in support for them. TheSend
API lets you dynamically create worker nodes and send them specific inputs. Each worker has its own state, and all worker outputs are written to a shared state key that is accessible to the orchestrator graph. This gives the orchestrator access to all worker output and allows it to synthesize them into a final output. The example below iterates over a list of sections and uses the Send
API to send a section to each worker.
Evaluator-optimizer
In evaluator-optimizer workflows, one LLM call creates a response and the other evaluates that response. If the evaluator or a human-in-the-loop determines the response needs refinement, feedback is provided and the response is recreated. This loop continues until an acceptable response is generated. Evaluator-optimizer workflows are commonly used when there’s particular success criteria for a task, but iteration is required to meet that criteria. For example, there’s not always a perfect match when translating text between two languages. It might take a few iterations to generate a translation with the same meaning across the two languages.Agents
Agents are typically implemented as an LLM performing actions using tools. They operate in continuous feedback loops, and are used in situations where problems and solutions are unpredictable. Agents have more autonomy than workflows, and can make decisions about the tools they use and how to solve problems. You can still define the available toolset and guidelines for how agents behave.Using tools
