create_agent
is built on LangGraph) so you can start high-level and drop down to granular control when needed.
Stable core APIs
Graph primitives (state, nodes, edges) and the execution/runtime model are unchanged, making upgrades straightforward.
Reliability, by default
Durable execution with checkpointing, persistence, streaming, and human-in-the-loop continues to be first-class.
Seamless with LangChain v1
LangChain’s
create_agent
runs on LangGraph. Use LangChain for a fast start; drop to LangGraph for custom orchestration.Deprecation of create_react_agent
The LangGraph create_react_agent
prebuilt has been deprecated in favor of LangChain’s create_agent
. It provides a simpler interface, and offers greater customization potential through the introduction of middleware.
- For information on the new
create_agent
API, see the LangChain v1 release notes. - For information on migrating from
