The following features are available in the following SDK versions:
- Python SDK: >=0.1.141
- JS/TS SDK: >=0.2.5
Attachment
type in Python and Uint8Array
/ ArrayBuffer
in TypeScript.
Python
In the Python SDK, you can use theAttachment
type to add files to your traces. Each Attachment
requires:
mime_type
(str): The MIME type of the file (e.g.,"image/png"
).data
(bytes | Path): The binary content of the file, or the file path.
(mime_type, data)
for convenience.
Simply decorate a function with @traceable
and include your Attachment
instances as arguments. Note that to use the file path instead of the raw bytes, you need to set the dangerously_allow_filesystem
flag to True
in your traceable decorator.
Python
TypeScript
In the TypeScript SDK, you can add attachments to traces by usingUint8Array
or ArrayBuffer
as data types. Each attachmentâ€™s MIME type is specified within extractAttachments
:
Uint8Array
: Useful for handling binary data directly.ArrayBuffer
: Represents fixed-length binary data, which can be converted toUint8Array
as needed.
traceable
and include your attachments within the extractAttachments
option.
In the TypeScript SDK, the extractAttachments
function is an optional parameter in the traceable
configuration. When the traceable-wrapped function is invoked, it extracts binary data (e.g., images, audio files) from your inputs and logs them alongside other trace data, specifying their MIME types.
Note that you cannot directly pass in a file path in the TypeScript SDK, as accessing local files is not supported in all runtime environments.
