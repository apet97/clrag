# langsmith-reject-concurrent

> Source: https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/reject-concurrent

This guide assumes knowledge of what double-texting is, which you can learn about in the double-texting conceptual guide.The guide covers the reject option for double texting, which rejects the new run of the graph by throwing an error and continues with the original run until completion. Below is a quick example of using the reject option.
Now, let’s import our required packages and instantiate our client, assistant, and thread.
Python
Javascript
CURL
Copy
import httpxfrom langchain_core.messages import convert_to_messagesfrom langgraph_sdk import get_clientclient = get_client(url=<DEPLOYMENT_URL>)# Using the graph deployed with the name "agent"assistant_id = "agent"thread = await client.threads.create()
Now we can run a thread and try to run a second one with the “reject” option, which should fail since we have already started a run:
Python
Javascript
CURL
Copy
run = await client.runs.create( thread["thread_id"], assistant_id, input={"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's the weather in sf?"}]},)try: await client.runs.create( thread["thread_id"], assistant_id, input={ "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's the weather in nyc?"}] }, multitask_strategy="reject", )except httpx.HTTPStatusError as e: print("Failed to start concurrent run", e)
Output:
Copy
Failed to start concurrent run Client error '409 Conflict' for url 'http://localhost:8123/threads/f9e7088b-8028-4e5c-88d2-9cc9a2870e50/runs'For more information check: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/409
We can verify that the original thread finished executing:
Python
Javascript
CURL
Copy
# wait until the original run completesawait client.runs.join(thread["thread_id"], run["run_id"])state = await client.threads.get_state(thread["thread_id"])for m in convert_to_messages(state["values"]["messages"]): m.pretty_print()
Output:
