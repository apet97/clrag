This guide assumes knowledge of what double-texting is, which you can learn about in the double-texting conceptual guide.The guide covers the interrupt option for double texting, which interrupts the prior run of the graph and starts a new one with the double-text. This option does not delete the first run, but rather keeps it in the database but sets its status to interrupted. Below is a quick example of using the interrupt option.
Now, letâ€™s import our required packages and instantiate our client, assistant, and thread.
Python
Javascript
CURL
Copy
import asynciofrom langchain_core.messages import convert_to_messagesfrom langgraph_sdk import get_clientclient = get_client(url=<DEPLOYMENT_URL>)# Using the graph deployed with the name "agent"assistant_id = "agent"thread = await client.threads.create()
Now we can start our two runs and join the second one until it has completed:
Python
Javascript
CURL
Copy
# the first run will be interruptedinterrupted_run = await client.runs.create( thread["thread_id"], assistant_id, input={"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's the weather in sf?"}]},)# sleep a bit to get partial outputs from the first runawait asyncio.sleep(2)run = await client.runs.create( thread["thread_id"], assistant_id, input={"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what's the weather in nyc?"}]}, multitask_strategy="interrupt",)# wait until the second run completesawait client.runs.join(thread["thread_id"], run["run_id"])
We can see that the thread has partial data from the first run + data from the second run
Python
Javascript
CURL
Copy
state = await client.threads.get_state(thread["thread_id"])for m in convert_to_messages(state["values"]["messages"]): m.pretty_print()
Output:
Copy
