Code evaluators are just functions that take a dataset example and the resulting application output, and return one or more metrics. These functions can be passed directly into evaluate() / aevaluate().
code evaluator functions must have specific argument names. They can take any subset of the following arguments:
run: Run: The full Run object generated by the application on the given example.
example: Example: The full dataset Example, including the example inputs, outputs (if available), and metdata (if available).
inputs: dict: A dictionary of the inputs corresponding to a single example in a dataset.
outputs: dict: A dictionary of the outputs generated by the application on the given inputs.
reference_outputs/referenceOutputs: dict: A dictionary of the reference outputs associated with the example, if available.
For most use cases you’ll only need inputs, outputs, and reference_outputs. run and example are useful only if you need some extra trace or example metadata outside of the actual inputs and outputs of the application.When using JS/TS these should all be passed in as part of a single object argument.
Code evaluators are expected to return one of the following types:Python and JS/TS
dict: dicts of the form {"score" | "value": ..., "key": ...} allow you to customize the metric type (“score” for numerical and “value” for categorical) and metric name. This if useful if, for example, you want to log an integer as a categorical metric.
Python only
int | float | bool: this is interepreted as an continuous metric that can be averaged, sorted, etc. The function name is used as the name of the metric.
str: this is intepreted as a categorical metric. The function name is used as the name of the metric.
list[dict]: return multiple metrics using a single function.
