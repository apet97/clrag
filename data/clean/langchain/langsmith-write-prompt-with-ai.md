Chat sidebar
You can use the chat sidebar to ask questions about your prompt, or to give instructions in natural language to the LLM for how to rewrite your prompt.You can also edit the prompt directly - you donâ€™t need to use the LLM. This is useful if you know what edits you want to make and just want to make them directly
