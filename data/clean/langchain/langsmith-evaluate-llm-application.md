# langsmith-evaluate-llm-application

> Source: https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/evaluate-llm-application

For larger evaluation jobs in Python we recommend using aevaluate(), the asynchronous version of evaluate(). It is still worthwhile to read this guide first, as the two have identical interfaces, before reading the how-to guide on running an evaluation asynchronously.In JS/TS evaluate() is already asynchronous so no separate method is needed.It is also important to configure the
max_concurrency
/maxConcurrency
arg when running large jobs. This parallelizes evaluation by effectively splitting the dataset across threads.Define an application
First we need an application to evaluate. Let’s create a simple toxicity classifier for this example.Create or select a dataset
We need a Dataset to evaluate our application on. Our dataset will contain labeled examples of toxic and non-toxic text. Requireslangsmith>=0.3.13
Define an evaluator
Evaluators are functions for scoring your application’s outputs. They take in the example inputs, actual outputs, and, when present, the reference outputs. Since we have labels for this task, our evaluator can directly check if the actual outputs match the reference outputs.
- Python: Requires
langsmith>=0.3.13
- TypeScript: Requires
langsmith>=0.2.9
Run the evaluation
We’ll use the evaluate() / aevaluate() methods to run the evaluation. The key arguments are:- a target function that takes an input dictionary and returns an output dictionary. The
example.inputs
field of each Example is what gets passed to the target function. In this case ourtoxicity_classifier
is already set up to take in example inputs so we can use it directly. data
- the name OR UUID of the LangSmith dataset to evaluate on, or an iterator of examplesevaluators
- a list of evaluators to score the outputs of the function
langsmith>=0.3.13
Explore the results
Each invocation ofevaluate()
creates an Experiment which can be viewed in the LangSmith UI or queried via the SDK. Evaluation scores are stored against each actual output as feedback.
If you’ve annotated your code for tracing, you can open the trace of each row in a side panel view.
