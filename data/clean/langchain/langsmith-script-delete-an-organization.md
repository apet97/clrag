Skip to main content
The LangSmith UI does not currently support the deletion of an individual organization from a self-hosted instance of LangSmith. This, however, can be accomplished by directly removing all traces from all materialized views in ClickHouse (except the runs_history views) and the runs and feedbacks tables and then removing the Organization from the Postgres tenants table.
This command using the Organization ID as an argument.
