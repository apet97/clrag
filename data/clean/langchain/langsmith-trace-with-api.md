The simplest way to log runs is via the POST and PATCH/runs
endpoint. These routes expect minimal contextual information about the tree structure to

"x-api-key"
.If your API key is linked to multiple workspaces, you will need to specify the workspace being used in the header with "x-tenant-id"

(for fast json ) and requests_toolbelt
to run
