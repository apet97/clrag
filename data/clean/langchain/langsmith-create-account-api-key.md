API keys
LangSmith supports two types of API keys: Service Keys and Personal Access Tokens. Both types of tokens can be used to authenticate requests to the LangSmith API, but they have different use cases. Read more about the differences between Service Keys and Personal Access Tokens under admin conceptsCreate an API key
To log traces and run evaluations with LangSmith, you will need to create an API key to authenticate your requests. API keys can be scoped to a set of workspaces, or the entire organization. To create either type of API key head to the Settings page, then scroll to the API Keys section. For service keys, choose between an organization-scoped and workspace-scoped key. If the key is workspace-scoped, the workspaces must then be specified. Enterprise users are also able to assign specific roles to the key, which adjusts its permissions. Set the keyâ€™s expiration; the key will become unusable after the number of days chosen, or never, if that is selected. Then click Create API Key.The API key will be shown only once, so make sure to copy it and store it in a safe place.
