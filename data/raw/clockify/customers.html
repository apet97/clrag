Response has been very good. The software answers the 3 key questions we have about our team. 1.) What did you work on today? 2) How much time have you been spending on any one project? 3) What projects are in the mix? Having the ability to mark billable vs. non-billable is a feature we will use as well. It had all the features I needed AND NONE of the ones I did not want. So it was not un-necessarily complicated. Thus the ease of use and intuitive nature of the software was excellent. The free price tag for these basic functions was a bonus.

I work part-time for a client working as his executive assistant and his bookkeeper. I was getting myself in a mess just using a timesheet created in MS Excel and when I discovered Clockify I was over the moon with joy. I keep Clockify open in the background and I switch projects when I start the work and when I finish the work. I used to under invoice for my time and lose income but now I can bill for every second I work on his projects. Also, it has great reporting function and can either print off or save as a PDF or Excel etc. So not only do I invoice my client, I've also got exact data for the time I carry out each of his tasks.</p><cite>&mdash; Ruth M.</cite></div>\r\n    <div class=\"customer-grid-item\"><br><p><span class=\"star-color\">\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</span></p><p><b>Great time tracking software, cheap cost, high vlaue</b></p><p>Value for money is insane. The free plan by far meets all my needs. Reporting. Detailed timing. Many projects and clients. When I upscale to team plan too the pricing is super competitive.

I divide my working hours between several internal and external projects that are both billable and non-billable. Each project/client can be assigned a different hourly rate.

A logo here, a little code there. I did not realize how much time I wasted until I started using Clockify. I did try a couple of other apps but none was that easy and offered similar tools. Once I got everything ready and started counting my hours I fast figured out how much I actually needed Clockify. The times of lost hours are gone. I have a clear overview and know with a couple of clicks how much time I spend on each project and even know what my client has to be charged. In a couple of days Clockify turned into one of my favorite tools and I use it now every single day. Incredible easy and fast to use.

After trying different apps that I usually forgot to use regularly, or that offer too few or too many features I stumbled upon this app that is easy to use, offer just the features that you need (such as projects, analytics) and that are easy to use both through web browser and on the phone I finally managed to keep track of the time spent during the day over different projects. If you click on any task that you previously tracked it will start another tracking instance which is really beneficial for repetitive tasks and tasked stopped due to interruptions. As I work on multiple projects at the same time it is usually very difficult to pinpoint how time is spent during a regular working day. After starting using the app regularly i.e. having a tab regularly open and using Android app always when on the go (meetings, etc.) I got a clear picture of how time is spent and which projects are regularly taking \"invisible time\" ie. time that is not billed. After setting up basic projects and tagging each activity with a project I can get basic overview of how I am spending my time at a glance. I don't need to submit my time sheet to anyone, so I am not using the reports as much, but I see this as a very useful feature for freelancers. The user interface is simple and focuses on one single thing - and switching between the web app - tab in the browser and the app on the phone is without any problems. Another thing worth mentioning is integration with gmail - so each time I get something via email that will take more than 2 min to complete I could just click on the button within the gmail and start tracking time for that task - for me it meant really understanding how much all those \"little tasks\" actually take. In a way I also use this as a log for what I've done and to see if I am meeting the goals I set to myself such as 'spending more time on product development instead on operational things', since at the end of a week you have a clear view of whether you actually did what you've said you would focus on.</p><cite>&mdash; Verified reviewer</cite></div>\r\n    <div class=\"customer-grid-item\"><br><p><span class=\"star-color\">\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</span></p><p><b>Very useful, free time tracker</b></p><p>Clockify is very easy to get started with and use.

To be able to see exactly which month I had spent how many hours (and minutes!) working on which project helps me greatly to plan my workload and to priorities.

You can also mark every entry as payable or non-payable and for our company, where we use Clockify to pay our employees on a monthly basis, this and the rest of the features are indispensable!

The different ways of categorising time entries is also really useful, but for me one of the best features of Clockify is its ability to integrate with other web applications such as Trello and Google Docs - making it even easier to track time. The fact that an API is available is also brilliant.

I mean the features are maybe somewhat different, but it's not like we had any issue of switching to this. The transition to this was very easy. This allowed us to have everybody to track their time instead of us having to pay for extra users (which ends up costing exponentially more). Besides we didn't miss out on any features with regard to the competitors. At the end of the day you'd like people to track their time so it's easier for you to estimate, calculate or see where the time goes. And this allows that without having to pay an astronomically amount of money. If we need extra reporting features we will definitely be upgrading without having a hearth attack. Thank you for that.</p><cite>&mdash; Wahid N.</cite></div>\r\n    <div class=\"customer-grid-item\"><br><p><span class=\"star-color\">\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</span></p><p><b>Control over project activities and goals</b></p><p>It is very fast to use.

The reporting is easy to pull, has great filters, and pretty (colored pie charts!) The free version is extremely feature-rich which means we can get fully invested in this tool now, and as we grow we know it will grow with us. We've had an amazing experience with Clockify, it filled a very needed hole in our agency for reporting on our time in a standard way across all team members.

I like that I can log in from any device and quickly log my projects. The interface is intuitive and uncluttered. Many other project management softwares I tried were complex and crowded. When I want to quickly and easily track my work, Clockify delivers. The method to input projects and clients (color coding, drop-down menu) helps me to maintain organization and see my work at-a-glance.

I appreciate the multi-faceted organization of having clients, projects, tasks, tags, etc. It's easy to understand and allows for flexibility within the product setup. Additionally, the easy to access reports allow for quick review of time tracking data without having to export to another format. I started utilizing Clockify to add some clarity to the work of my company's small 3-person UX team. We wanted more insight into how we were utilizing our time. We work across products so we set up each product as a client, each project as a project within the client, and then create tasks to determine how much time we spent on design, research, meetings, etc. per project. Additionally, we've added tags for greater specificity within some of those tasks. This allows us to see a wide variety of information such as how many projects we've worked on in a given period, how long we spent in meetings vs. designing during a certain quarter, which products demand the most of our attention, etc.</p><cite>&mdash; Graciela B.</cite></div>\r\n    <div class=\"customer-grid-item\"><br><p><span class=\"star-color\">\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</span></p><p><b>Clockify Review </b></p><p>I enjoy using clockify because it allows me to track the time I spend on working for my clients.

I love how Clockify allows my contractors to independently log their billable hours for me to easily monitor and issue calculate payroll! My contractors make different rates for different types of work, so the ability to assign variable pay rates to workers AND to different positions is perfect for my needs.

If I need to put fixed hours, clockify gives ability to do so. Overall experience with clockify I rate as 8.5/10. It's a must dev time logging tool.

My company decided to replace our previous time tracking software with Clockify just over two years ago and it didn't take long before the rest of the employees began using it. Credit should be given to its easy UI compared to the previous software we used which looked complicated and took some training. So overall I'd recommend this to business owners looking to make time tracking easy for their employees and themselves. Clockify makes it easier for folks at the company I work for and myself to generate a timesheet report for any specific period. Normally payroll would ask us for a monthly time report before they pay us so this comes in handy plus it's very simple to generate with just a few clicks.</p><cite>&mdash; Chavez H.</cite></div>\r\n    <div class=\"customer-grid-item\"><br><p><span class=\"star-color\">\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</span></p><p><b>Straightforward Time Tracking Software -- Easy to Learn, Easier to Use </b></p><p>There are two features that really stand out when it comes to Clockify. The first being its compatibility across a number of devices. I can track my time via the web app or desktop app while working from my home office, then just as easily use the mobile app to record how long I've spent working on my train ride into the city, all without having to worry about issues with syncing between my devices. The second feature that I absolutely love about Clockify is how granular it allows you to be when tracking your activities. You have complete control with the ability to create clients, assign projects to those clients, and even generate tasks within each project. And when it's time to use the tracker, just pick which project you want to track from the drop-down. The projects are separated by clients with submenus for each project displaying that project's tasks. You even have the option to add further description in the 'What are you working on?' field. This level of detail is critical when it comes to recording my time for invoicing purposes. On the other hand, if you need to just record the time and fill in the details later - you can do that too! As a software developer working on small projects while putting myself through school, I have to be very careful with how I manage my time. Clockify provides me with a great solution to keep myself accountable for my waking hours. With its feature to add clients, I'm able to record the time I spend studying separately from my work hours by listing my education institution under one client and my contracts under their own respective clients. The reporting feature is insightful in breaking down my time by my desired filters (date, client, project, task, etc.). It enables me to keep my clients happy with accurate progress reports and estimated completion dates as well as help me gauge my progress in my school's curriculum. Tracking my time using Clockify has definitely kept my life on track! </p><cite>&mdash; Meghan G.</cite></div>\r\n    <div class=\"customer-grid-item\"><br><p><span class=\"star-color\">\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</span></p><p><b>So easy to use I didn't have to see any tutorial</b></p><p>I loved the UX and design it's so easy to use that I didn't need any tutorial.

It's easy to use, and everyone is happy with the user interface. You can choose billable vs nonbillable hours, and it makes our payment system so much less of a headache.

It's simple yet versatile and serves my needs. I generally charge my clients a flat fee per project or per month. One day I realized tracking the time spent per client or project might be a good idea. Then, I can see if the rate seems fair, or if certain tasks are taking longer than seems reasonable. I like being able start a timer in one tab of my browser that runs in the background while I work. I also like having the option to manually add time worked if I was not running the timer. Being able to pause the timer to take a break and then resume the timer on the same task is very convenient. Clockify will keep track of the total time worked. If you need to, you can drill down to see the start and stop times for each session. The reporting feature lets you choose from several common time intervals (this week, past two weeks, last month, etc.); but they also give you the flexibility to choose a custom range from a specific date to a specific date.</p><cite>&mdash; Danielle N.</cite></div>\r\n    <div class=\"customer-grid-item\"><br><p><span class=\"star-color\">\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</span></p><p><b>Makes my job so much easier!</b></p><p>It took me all but 5 minutes to figure out!

You can put in the description of your task without hassle. I love it! It has saved me so much time when it comes to billing my hours because I can categorize tasks and color code them. The ability to run reports based on client, task, or category saves me a lot of time during billing because I am able to see how much time I spent on certain categories. For example, I charge a client X amount for consultancy hours and Y amount for training hours. So I have a consulting and a training category.

It also helps me to visualize when it is time to wrap it up and move onto another pending project.</p><cite>&mdash; Jennifer S.</cite></div>\r\n    <div class=\"customer-grid-item\"><br><p><span class=\"star-color\">\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</span></p><p><b>Clockify is awesome</b></p><p>Clockify is so easy to use and does everything i need it to.</p><cite>&mdash; Sandra H.</cite></div>\r\n    <div class=\"customer-grid-item\"><br><p><span class=\"star-color\">\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</span></p><p><b>Great Time Tracking!</b></p><p>The Time tracking features are great, especially for businesses with 3 or more employees.

This app strikes the right balance between easy to use and highly configurable. I love the ability to set a bunch of different lables/categories up the first few uses and easily search and bookmark them for future use. Lots of the tasks that I am tracking fall into the same categories on a daily basis, so it's important to have these easily accessible when marking a task. Every time I switch tasks, I can easily end the current with one click and start the next one, name it, and categorize it in just 3 clicks.

It lets me set different workspaces and keep everything neatly organized without wasting time wondering what's what. I can easily create a project, add the tasks I need to complete, add a tag or note for the specific task I'm tracking, and start the timer. Even when the timer is running and it sits next to my working document, it never distracts me with intense colors or moving elements that I've found annoying in other apps. The best thing I love about it, though, is how easy I can filter through the reports. This is invaluable, especially when you want to keep an eye on how much something is taking you, so you know how much time to allocate for a similar task in the future. I use Clockify internally, so I don't use the team or client specific features, but it's all readily accessible so it's always there if and when I need to access those features. The other major pro for me is that it's not a software that forces you into an upgrade or limits the features you can use if you're on the free plan. That is something I value a lot as a marketer and user, so if my needs grow beyond using it for my own projects, I wouldn't think twice about supporting Clockify over other options. Clockify took away one of my biggest headaches: having a time-tracking tool that's not intrusive in any way but one that's flexible, simple, easy to navigate and - most importantly - get a sense of how much time you spend on a task every week.</p><cite>&mdash; Ralitsa M.</cite></div>\r\n    <div class=\"customer-grid-item\"><br><p><span class=\"star-color\">\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</span></p><p><b>Easy way to keep track of time by task or project</b></p><p>The extension on your web-browser and the way the software integrates with basecamp and other applications makes it easy to track time by task.</p><cite>&mdash; Dee W.</cite></div>\r\n    <div class=\"customer-grid-item\"><br><p><span class=\"star-color\">\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</span></p><p><b>Clockify is a game-changer</b></p><p>I love Clockify!

It's a wonderful free way to keep track of time and projects for the work I do for each of my several clients. I'd gotten advice from my peers that Clockify was great and you get tons of great features for free. Since starting to use Clockify, I won't switch.

We haven't had to use customer support as we haven't experienced any long term issues. We're now able to identify ways in which to improve profitability for the company. Has increased the accuracy of time being tracked, as well as encouraging team members to track who were previously poor at doing so.</p><cite>&mdash; Sharon W.</cite></div>\r\n    <div class=\"customer-grid-item\"><br><p><span class=\"star-color\">\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</span></p><p><b>Best time tracking app out there </b></p><p>I most love how easy this app is able to integrate into my workflow. It literally only takes me a few clicks to switch gears to a different project. So when a customer calls up and I need to start tracking my time differently, I can switch my time to a new task (before I even know what the task is) and once the customer fills me in on the needs of the call, I can start to detail the clock that is still running, without interrupting anything. Overall, Clockify has helped streamline my small business. I no longer have to worry about keeping timestamps in my head while picking up the phone, or jotting a quick note down that I'll forget what it's in reference to later. Clockify has made me more efficient, and more accurate, two things that are wonderfully customer-centric.</p><cite>&mdash; Joel B.</cite></div>\r\n    <div class=\"customer-grid-item\"><br><p><span class=\"star-color\">\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</span></p><p><b>Easy synced time logging</b></p><p>I love the fact that my time logged across all my devices in the could. i don't have to worry about</p><cite>&mdash; Reggie L.</cite></div>\r\n    <div class=\"customer-grid-item\"><br><p><span class=\"star-color\">\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</span></p><p><b>Excellent for labor-based pricing</b></p><p>Clockify makes it really easy for me to time my labor on various projects.

Clockify is extremely helpful for keeping track of all the little bits of time I spend on all these various projects. Before Clockify, the only way I could report my time (so it could be charged to the correct projects) was to look back through the email I had sent all week and guess how much time each effort took. Now I can just look at the Clockify report and report the actual hours spent on each! The reporting is not the whole benefit, though. If the recording were a hassle, I wouldn't use the tool - no matter how good the reporting. Fortunately, reporting time in Clockify is quick and easy. I can just enter text for the project, hit a button, and I'm off. If the project already exists, it's even easier - just press the \"play\" button next to the project. Altering time is easy too.</p><cite>&mdash; Mark F.</cite></div>\r\n    <div class=\"customer-grid-item\"><br><p><span class=\"star-color\">\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</span></p><p><b>A really useful tool</b></p><p>Easy to use.

Also having the ability to setup weekly reminders should someone not log hours that meets the threshold really helps timely data entry. Even having different ways to enter time (tracker versus timesheet) has really helped adoption of the application. Allowing staff to enter as much or as little detail on their time entries has again added on another layer of end user adoption. Being able to \"group\" time entries based on projects has been a LIFE SAVER when it comes to reporting for grants or payroll. Clockify was so simple to implement and overall received a fairly quick buy in from the whole team. We write a number of grants each year for financial support and Clockify reports has saved so much time for our grant writer (whether it be based on a person or a project). And when we need to update the Accountant with vacation hours used in the past month, we no longer have to pull together multiple spreadsheets (we currently have 18 staff using Clockify). From an administrator standpoint, it was fairly easy to build out and has been pretty simple to manage once we were up and running.

But, being a project manager in a small business the best thing was unlimited users for free! We have a lot of contractors and to have them be able to track time under our business anywhere for free is pretty awesome! Some projects we will have 3-7 people or more so it's fantastic that we don't need to pay for extra users every time we have a big project. I also enjoy the fact that you can assign a task to each user as a free option as well. There isn't a lot of limitations with Clockify's free option which was something that I kept running into with other time tracking software. My overall experience with Clockify has been great! I'm with a start-up small business and this was a perfect system to get our whole team time tracking! We have been using clockify since April and already start seeing results of estimates going over and catching when we've been going over hours in different departments. This also is a tool for our hourly tracking employees to help get more accurate results. Overall this has helped with tracking how we are doing as a company and helping us see how many billable hours we bring in. Thank you for such an awesome system! </p><cite>&mdash; Erica D.</cite></div>\r\n    <div class=\"customer-grid-item\"><br><p><span class=\"star-color\">\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</span></p><p><b>Clocking in has never been easier</b></p><p>This software is so convenient and easy to use!

Our business went from tracking hours on a notepad to this incredible program. What a tremendous difference it has made! It's free AND it allows us to clock in and clock out for specific hours/days instead of the traditional timer. Most of the other programs we considered are a pay-by-user. Also, the other programs we considered only had options to start a timer or fix time for that day. However, Clockify allows us to enter time manually for weeks previous, days in advance, etc. We have found that the reports are customizable on Clockify where other programs did not allow us to customize dates.</p><cite>&mdash; Gabrielle W.</cite></div>\r\n    <div class=\"customer-grid-item\"><br><p><span class=\"star-color\">\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</span></p><p><b>Simple, that's what's great about it </b></p><p>It doesn't try to do too much and end up cluttering the interface.

On the main screen, you can simply hit the start button on the project you're working on and hit again whenever you stop and it will add directly a new entry on the log of that project. That's pretty quick when you need just to focus on the work. Besides this, on this screen you can also select each entry and decide if it will be billable to the customer or not by just hitting another button. A really useful feature on Clockify is that you can set by default a billing price for your time, but also you're able to set a specific price per project, so when you set billable time to any project, it will apply the specific price in case it is set or the default one in the other case. The dashboard section is also quite nice, but less useful, but anyway it shows some interesting info such as total time worked, or total earnings, most active projects and so on. Then maybe the most interesting feature are the reports since are the ones that allows you to collect all the generated data. They are really flexible and allows a wide variety of different results by using the filters and the data are really well presented using some charts and tables. And to finish, a nice feature is the ability of have shared projects with more people, this way you can log the time of the whole team and being able to decide if the time is billable or not, allows you some interesting posibilities.</p><cite>&mdash; Simeon R.R.</cite></div>\r\n    <div class=\"customer-grid-item\"><br><p><span class=\"star-color\">\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605</span></p><p><b>A very good app</b></p><p>Ease of use and multi platform (web plugin, web app, android app).

I'm salary, and i currently make up the entire engineering team. i use Clockify to quantify how much time i spend on various tasks/projects to get an idea of the R&D cost to the company for any given product. It also doubles as a good way to gauge how long you have been doing a specific task. i find it helps keep me on task, and helps me to recognize when I'm multitasking when I'd rather be focusing on one task. Though tracking your time is difficult at first, sort've like a new excersize regimen, eventually the brain becomes accustomed and it is super easy to do.

Right on the initial screen you can create a Project, mark as billable or not, add tags, select a specific client and start your tracking on that task. You can use the Dashboard to see the time you've spent on each Project filtering by time period, billability and if you worked alone or with your team. You can also see the most tracked activities and the top Project you worked on. In the Reports tab you can filter by almost all information on your tracking, export to various formats, print and share your reports. You can do A LOT of customizations in your Projects and in your Team configurations, manage your Workspace, tags and clients and set limitations to some roles on the Team. All of this on the FREE VERSION!!! It's awesome that a marvelous software has so many free resources! You has three paid plan options that allow you to: Round time, limit what Projects the user can see, set required fields on time entries, lock changes in entries, update your lock date, hide pages from regular users, cost analysis, time approval, create alerts, manage accounts, authentication and custom fields. It has a simple and clean interface where you can find ANYTHING with ease and there's a Help tab with Documentation, Tutorials and Support. Clockify changed my way of work for better!

Each person on the team can work on one of six different projects over the course of a 2-week pay period. We used to have a paper timesheet with six different columns, one for each project, where the staff would fill in their hours for the correct project and day. When the time came to process those timesheets and send the information to our payroll department, I had to collect 55 timesheets and calculate totals for each project and day. Needless to say, it took a substantial amount of time to complete. Then we found Clockify. It is very simple and allows our staff to enter start and end time for activities in an app. I can then see in the Dashboard who has worked where and when, and complete my payroll. I can also generate a spreadsheet and store it for archive and auditing purposes. Because I work at a charity organization, and we have little to no budget, the fact that Clockify is free for unlimited number is users is a major plus. <span class=\"yellow-highlight\">Clockify is just what I need. It's simple enough that people will use it, and it gives me access to the backend information for calculating payroll.</span></p><cite>&mdash; Steve Wideman, Director of Community Programs, YMCA of Niagara</cite></blockquote></div>\r\n      <div class=\"customer-grid-item\"><blockquote><p><span class=\"yellow-highlight\">THANK YOU for making a free time tracking app!</span></p><cite>&mdash; Ludovic Maillard</cite></blockquote></div>\r\n      <div class=\"customer-grid-item\"><blockquote><p>I like your services and now use them every day. the calendar is my favorite as I currently use google calendar to track my whole life. i don't think you can offer me anything i want outside of what you provide already.......
