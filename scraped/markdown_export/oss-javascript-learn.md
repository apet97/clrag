LangGraph v1.0Welcome to the new LangGraph documentation! If you encounter any issues or have feedback, please open an issue so we can improve. Archived v0 documentation can be found here.See the release notes and migration guide for a complete list of changes and instructions on how to upgrade your code.
Use Cases
Below are tutorials for common use cases, organized by framework.LangChain
LangChain agent implementations make it easy to get started for most use cases.Semantic Search
Build a semantic search engine over a PDF with LangChain components.
RAG Agent
Create a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) agent.
SQL Agent
Build a SQL agent to interact with databases with human-in-the-loop review.
LangGraph
LangChain’s agent implementations use LangGraph primitives. If deeper customization is required, agents can be implemented directly in LangGraph.Custom RAG Agent
Build a RAG agent using LangGraph primitives for fine-grained control.
Conceptual Overviews
These guides explain the core concepts and APIs underlying LangChain and LangGraph.Memory
