, you get built-in observability through LangSmith - a powerful platform for tracing, debugging, evaluating, and monitoring your LLM applications.
Traces capture every step your agent takes, from the initial user input to the final response, including all tool calls, model interactions, and decision points. This enables you to debug your agents, evaluate performance, and monitor usage.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:- A LangSmith account (free to sign up)
Enable tracing
All LangChain agents automatically support LangSmith tracing. To enable it, set the following environment variables:Quick start
No extra code is needed to log a trace to LangSmith. Just run your agent code as you normally would:default
