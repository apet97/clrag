Sharing a trace publicly will make it accessible to anyone with the link. Make sure you’re not sharing sensitive information.If your self-hosted or hybrid LangSmith deployment is within a VPC, then the public link is accessible only to members authenticated within your VPC. For enhanced security, we recommend configuring your instance with a private URL accessible only to users with access to your network.
- Click on Unshare by clicking on Public in the upper right hand corner of any publicly shared trace, then Unshare in the dialog.
- Navigate to your organization’s list of publicly shared traces, by clicking on Settings -> Shared URLs, then click on Unshare next to the trace you want to unshare.
