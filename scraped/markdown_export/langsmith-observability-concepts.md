Runs
A run is a span representing a single unit of work or operation within your LLM application. This could be anything from a single call to an LLM or chain, to a prompt formatting call, to a runnable lambda invocation. If you are familiar with OpenTelemetry, you can think of a run as a span.Traces
A trace is a collection of runs for a single operation. For example, if you have a user request that triggers a chain, and that chain makes a call to an LLM, then to an output parser, and so on, all of these runs would be part of the same trace. If you are familiar with OpenTelemetry, you can think of a LangSmith trace as a collection of spans. Runs are bound to a trace by a unique trace ID.Projects
A project is a collection of traces. You can think of a project as a container for all the traces that are related to a single application or service. You can have multiple projects, and each project can have multiple traces.Feedback
Feedback allows you to score an individual run based on certain criteria. Each feedback entry consists of a feedback tag and feedback score, and is bound to a run by a unique run ID. Feedback can be continuous or discrete (categorical), and you can reuse feedback tags across different runs within an organization. You can collect feedback on runs in a number of ways:- Sent up along with a trace from the LLM application.
- Generated by a user in the app inline or in an annotation queue.
- Generated by an automatic evaluator during offline evaluation.
- Generated by an online evaluator.
Tags
Tags are collections of strings that can be attached to runs. You can use tags to do the following in the LangSmith UI:- Categorize runs for easier search.
- Filter runs.
- Group runs together for analysis.
Metadata
Metadata is a collection of key-value pairs that you can attach to runs. You can use metadata to store additional information about a run, such as the version of the application that generated the run, the environment in which the run was generated, or any other information that you want to associate with a run. Similarly to tags, you can use metadata to filter runs in the LangSmith UI or group runs together for analysis. Learn how to add metadata to your traces.Data storage and retention
For traces ingested on or after Wednesday, May 22, 2024, LangSmith (SaaS) retains trace data for a maximum of 400 days past the date and time the trace was inserted into the LangSmith trace database. After 400 days, the traces are permanently deleted from LangSmith, with a limited amount of metadata retained for the purpose of showing accurate statistics, such as historic usage and cost.If you wish to keep tracing data longer than the data retention period, you can add it to a dataset. A dataset allows you to store the trace inputs and outputs (e.g., as a key-value dataset), and will persist indefinitely, even after the trace gets deleted.
Deleting traces from LangSmith
If you need to remove a trace from LangSmith before its expiration date, you can do so by deleting the project that contains it. You can delete a project with one of the following ways:- In the LangSmith UI, select the Delete option on the projectâ€™s overflow menu.
- With the
delete_tracer_sessions
API endpoint - With the
delete_project()
(Python) ordeleteProject()
(JS/TS) in the LangSmith SDK.
