LangGraph v1.0Welcome to the new LangGraph documentation! If you encounter any issues or have feedback, please open an issue so we can improve. Archived v0 documentation can be found here.See the release notes and migration guide for a complete list of changes and instructions on how to upgrade your code.
To install the base LangGraph package:
Copy
npm install @langchain/langgraph @langchain/core
To use LangGraph you will usually want to access LLMs and define tools.
You can do this however you see fit.One way to do this (which we will use in the docs) is to use LangChain.Install LangChain with:
Copy
npm install langchain
To work with specific LLM provider packages, you will need install them separately.Refer to the integrations page for provider-specific installation instructions.
