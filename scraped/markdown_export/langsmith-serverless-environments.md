When tracing JavaScript functions, LangSmith will trace runs in the background by default to avoid adding latency. In serverless environments where the execution context may be terminated abruptly, itâ€™s important to ensure that all tracing data is properly flushed before the function completes.
To make sure this occurs, you can either:
- Set an environment variable named
LANGSMITH_TRACING_BACKGROUND
to"false"
. This will cause your traced functions to wait for tracing to complete before returning.- Note that this is named differently from the environment variable in LangChain.js because LangSmith can be used without LangChain.
- Pass a custom client into your traced runs and
await
theclient.awaitPendingTraceBatches();
method.
awaitPendingTraceBatches
alongside the traceable
method:
manualFlushMode: true
in your client like this:
client.flush()
like this before your serverless function closes:
.flush()
.
