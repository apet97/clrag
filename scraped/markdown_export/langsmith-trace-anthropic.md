wrap_anthropic
methods in Python allows you to wrap your Anthropic client in order to automatically log traces â€” no decorator or function wrapping required! Using the wrapper ensures that messages, including tool calls and multimodal content blocks will be rendered nicely in LangSmith. The wrapper works seamlessly with the @traceable
decorator or traceable
function and you can use both in the same application.
The
LANGSMITH_TRACING
environment variable must be set to 'true'
in order for traces to be logged to LangSmith, even when using wrap_anthropic
. This allows you to toggle tracing on and off without changing your code.Additionally, you will need to set the LANGSMITH_API_KEY
environment variable to your API key (see Setup for more information).If your LangSmith API key is linked to multiple workspaces, set the LANGSMITH_WORKSPACE_ID
environment variable to specify which workspace to use.By default, the traces will be logged to a project named default
. To log traces to a different project, see this section.
