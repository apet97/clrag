Documentation
LangChain is the platform for agent engineering. AI teams at Replit, Clay, Rippling, Cloudflare, Workday, and more trust LangChainâ€™s products to engineer reliable agents.Our open source frameworks help you build agents:- LangChain helps you quickly get started building agents, with any model provider of your choice.
- LangGraph allows you to control every step of your custom agent with low-level orchestration, memory, and human-in-the-loop support. You can manage long-running tasks with durable execution.
- Observability to see exactly how your agent thinks and acts with detailed tracing and aggregate trend metrics.
- Evaluation to test and score agent behavior on production data and offline datasets for continuous improvement.
- Deployment to ship your agent in one click, using scalable infrastructure built for long-running tasks.
