Content we’re excited to promote
Educational content
Educational content
Blogs, YouTube videos and other media showcasing educational content. Note that we prefer content that is NOT framed as “here’s how to use integration XYZ”, but rather “here’s how to do ABC”, as we find that is more educational and helpful for developers.
End-to-end applications
End-to-end applications
End-to-end applications are great resources for developers looking to build. We prefer to highlight applications that are more complex/agentic in nature, and that use LangGraph as the orchestration framework. We get particularly excited about anything involving:
- Long-term memory systems
- Human-in-the-loop interaction patterns
- Multi-agent architectures
Research
Research
We love highlighting novel research! Whether it is research built on top of LangChain or that integrates with it.
