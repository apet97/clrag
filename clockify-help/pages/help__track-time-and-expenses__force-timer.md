# Force timer

1 min read

Disable manual mode in Workspace Settings so users can’t add time manually.

Force timer is a paid feature, which you can enable by [upgrading](https://clockify.me/pricing) your workspace to Pro or Enterprise plan.

You can enable “Force timer” at the bottom of the Permissions tab in Workspace Settings.

While Force timer is enabled, users:

* CAN create new entries using only timer (manual mode is disabled)
* CAN add time entries via the [Auto tracker](https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/auto-tracker) (Windows app only)
* CAN delete existing entries (unless [locked](https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/approval) or [approved](https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/approval))
* CAN change entry’s description, project/task, tag, and billable status (unless [locked](https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/approval) or [approved](https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/approval))
* CAN’T change start time of a running timer
* CAN’T change start/end time and duration of an existing time entry
* CAN’T duplicate an entry

Restriction applies to all users, including Admins. Admins can’t add time manually through the Time Tracker, but they can [add time for others](https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/add-time-for-others) (including themselves) via the Detailed report.

Team managers can add/edit time for their team members if enabled in Settings.
