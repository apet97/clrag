# Team overview

3 min read

As a Manager in Clockify, one of your key responsibilities is to invite and manage the members of your team.

Use these instructions to learn how to:

* Invite team members to your workspace
* Manage team profiles and roles after the invitation is accepted

Only Admins can invite new users and manage roles within the workspace. As a Manager, you have certain permissions, but you cannot invite users or edit certain profile settings.

To manage your team:

1. Navigate to the **Team** page
2. The page displays a list of all the current users in your workspace (**Full** and **Limited**)

As a **Manager**, you have specific permissions that give you access to manage your team without the ability to make major administrative changes. Here’s a breakdown of what you can and cannot do:

### Project Manager [#](#project-manager)

* **Can access**: Team page, Limited page, member hourly rates, cost rates, roles, and group members.
* **Cannot**: Add new members, deactivate users, transfer ownership, edit member profiles, remove deactivated members, or export members.

### Team Manager [#](#team-manager)

* **Can access**: Team page, Limited page, member hourly rates, cost rates, roles, and group members.
* **Cannot**: Add new members, deactivate users, transfer ownership, edit member profiles, remove deactivated members, or activate users.

## Team overview [#](#team-overview)

You can manage your team in the following way:

* **Search by name or email**:  
  Search for specific members by using the search bar on the **Team** page.
* **Use Show filter**:  
  The **Show filter** allows you to quickly view specific team members based on their roles or status (active/inactive).
* **Team grouping**:  
  Grouping your users by role, group, or status will help streamline team management and reporting.
