# Submit time & expenses for approval

4 min read

Users can submit their weekly, monthly and semi-monthly timesheets and expenses for approval. As an **Admin/Team manager**, you need to review these submissions to verify billable hours and project expenses before approving them for client invoicing.

**Time**

Time approval is a paid feature, which you can enable by [upgrading](https://clockify.me/pricing) your workspace to Standard, Pro, or Enterprise plan.

**Expenses**

To submit expenses for approval, you need to activate **Expense tracking** in the workspace settings. This way, when you submit tracked time for the approval, tracked expenses will also be submitted for that time period and vice versa.

Expense approval is a paid feature which you can enable by [upgrading](https://clockify.me/pricing) to Pro or Enterprise plan.

Timesheets are still editable while the time period/expense is pending approval. Changes for pending timesheets are automatically reflected and displayed when approving time.

If you hover over the Pending approval tag, you’ll see the name of the user who submitted the Expenses. By clicking on **Withdraw pending**, you can withdraw the approval. If you do that, an Admin or Manager won’t be able to approve time and expenses unless you send it again.
