# How do I set up a policy?

2 min read

In Clockify, there are two types of policies you can set up on the Time Off page.

## Holiday policies [#](#holiday-policies)

Holiday policies are used for public holidays like Christmas Day, New Year’s Day, or any other non-working day your organization observes.

* When you assign users to a holiday policy, they’ll be automatically marked as off on those dates
* Holidays will be visible on the Timesheet, Calendar, Approvals, and Reports if the automatic time off entry creation is enabled
* Users do not need to submit a request; it’s automatic

You can also choose whether holidays:

* Occur annually
* Automatically create time entries on the day of the holiday

## Time Off policies [#](#time-off-policies)

Time off policies are used for user-submitted requests like vacation, sick leave, personal days, etc.

* The user must submit a request in order to take time off
* Time off will only be counted once the request is approved (if required)

When creating a time off policy, you can customize settings such as:

* Whether it requires approval
* Whether time off accrues monthly or annually
* If users are allowed to take half-days
* Whether to automatically create time entries once approved
* Whether to allow negative balances

**How to create a policy (both types)**

1. Go to the Time Off page
2. Click on the cog icon in  the top-right corner
3. Choose either Manage Holidays or Manage Policies
4. In the pop-up window, select “Create New”
5. Fill in the policy name, assignees, and other relevant settings
6. Save the policy

You can create as many holiday or time off policies as needed and assign them to specific individuals or entire teams.
