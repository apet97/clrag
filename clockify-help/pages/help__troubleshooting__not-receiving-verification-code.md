# I’m not receiving a verification code

If you are not receiving a verification code, here are some possible reasons why that might happen and how to resolve them.

If you are using Gmail or an Apple ID, you can select ‘continue with Google’ or ‘continue with Apple,’ respectively.

## Ensure that you’ve entered a valid email address

More often than not, emails entered on the log-in screen contain a typo, which will result in codes being sent to a different email address. Double-check that the email address is correct.

## Verification codes ended up in your spam or junk folders

Make sure to check your spam and junk folders, and also ensure that your mailbox has enough space to receive new messages.

## Messages are queued or being placed in quarantine by your email provider

To resolve this issue, we recommend contacting the administrator of your email domain or an email provider so they can check for quarantined messages and release them.

 If you’re using Outlook, here’s a quick guide on how you can access your quarantine:
