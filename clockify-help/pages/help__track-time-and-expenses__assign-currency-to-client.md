# Assign currency to client

4 min read

In case you’re working on projects for clients that use various currencies, instead of using one currency on a workspace level for all your projects, you can assign different currencies to different clients.   
  
For example: *Client A is using US dollars as a currency and Client B euros. You can record project-related expenses in US dollars for Client A and in euros for Client B.*

The currency assigned on a workspace level is assigned by default to all the clients available in the workspace. To assign currency to a client, you need to be an admin and your workspace needs to be on a **PRO** or higher subscription plan.

## Assign currency [#](#assign-currency)

To assign currency to client:

1. Go to the **Clients** page in your workspace
2. In the list of **Clients,** locatetheclient you wish to edit
3. Click on the **Edit** button next to their name
4. Choose the currency from the search bar that appears with all available currencies in the workspace

Currency assigned to a client will be referred to as **client currency** hereafter.

#### Trial [#](#trial)

* After downgrade or the end of a trial period, all currencies are changed back to the default currency
* Subscription restores currency settings that were in place before the trial period

Currency is present in all client-related actions, from the client creation or editing, to the amount overview in the dashboard, project status and so on. If other than default currency is assigned to a client, it affects **adding time entries** throughout the app and **Clients**, **Expenses**, **Reports**, **Projects** and **Invoices** pages.

#### Clients [#](#clients)

By default, every default client gets a default workspace currency.

Whenever the currency related to the client changes, updated currency values will be presented with the new one being marked as updated.

#### Adding time entries in Time tracker, Timesheet, Calendar, Detailed report [#](#adding-time-entries-in-time-tracker-timesheet-calendar-detailed-report)

Entry’s billable and cost amounts are calculated in **default currency** if:

* entry doesn’t have a project
* entry’s project doesn’t have a client

Entry’s billable and cost amounts are calculated in **client currency** if:

* entry’s project has a client with assigned specific currency

For imported entries, currency is derived from the project.

Currency is related to the client, not entry, so if the currency is changed on a client level, all entries assigned to those client’s projects will get a new currency. Also, if a project or a client related to that project is deleted, all time entries related to that project get the default currency.

#### Expenses [#](#expenses)

In case currency is assigned to client,the **default currency** is still used when:

* adding a new expense category that has a unit price
* expense’s project is deleted from the workspace
* project’s client is deleted from the workspace

If client currency, or default currency changes, those changes will not impact the already existing records, only the future ones.

#### Report [#](#report)

You can filter out reports by currencies, or find a currency in the search bar at the top of the page.

Different client currencies are displayed in summary report, time and expense reports and exported formats.

#### Project [#](#project)

The currency displayed in projects is the one related to the client. If there is no client on the project, the default currency is displayed.

#### Invoices  [#](#invoices)

Since all invoices are made for a specific client, the amount is displayed in client currency. If the client’s invoice is updated, the existing invoice is updated to that currency, as well.
