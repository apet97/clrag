# Manage time off for your team

5 min read

As a **Team manager** or **Project manager**, managing time off requests for your team is a key responsibility. You’ll need to approve or reject requests (depending on your permissions), and track team members’ balances and accruals to ensure everything is organized and accurate. This guide will walk you through how to set up and manage time off policies, request time off, and approve or reject time off requests for your team.

## Key features & permissions [#](#key-features-permissions)

* **Time off** is a paid feature available on the **Standard**, **Pro**, or **Enterprise** plans
* Time off policies enable you to manage vacation days, holidays, sick leave, and other types of leave, along with accruals and balances
* **Managers** can approve or reject time off requests based on the policies you set (with appropriate permissions)
* As a **Team manager** or **Project manager**, you can also **withdraw** or **edit** your own requests and those of your team members (with appropriate permissions)

## Request time off [#](#request-time-off)

As a **Team manager** or **Project manager**, you’ll need to understand how your team can request time off, and how you can manage those requests. You can also request time off on behalf of your team members if needed.

### Steps to request time off [#](#steps-to-request-time-off)

1. Navigate to the **Time off** page from the sidebar
2. Click the **Request time off** button
3. Choose the appropriate time off policy from the dropdown (e.g. vacation, sick leave, etc.)  
   You will see how many days/hours you have available.
4. Select the start and end dates for your time off  
   Please note that holidays and weekends will not be counted toward the total time off.
5. You can add a note for the approver (e.g. Vacation with family)
6. Once everything is filled in, click **Submit**

### Manage time off requests for Team members [#](#manage-time-off-requests-for-team-members)

As a **Manager**, you can:

* Approve or reject time off requests for users you manage or supervise (Team manager only)
* Withdraw your own requests or those of your team members (if pending)
* Track balances and see the history of time off requests

## Approve time off requests [#](#approve-time-off-requests)

As a **Manager**, one of your primary responsibilities will be to approve or reject time off requests based on the policies you’ve defined.

### Steps to approve or reject requests [#](#steps-to-approve-or-reject-requests)

1. Go to the **Time off** page from the sidebar
2. In the **Requests** tab, find the request you want to review
3. Click **Approve**
4. Or open the three-dots menu and choose **Reject**  
   If you reject a request, you need to add a note explaining why it was rejected.
5. Once approved, the user will be notified, and the time off will be automatically added to their balance

## Email notifications [#](#email-notifications)

Time off requests trigger email notifications for both the user requesting the time off and the manager approving the request.

* When a request is approved or rejected, both the requester and their manager receive a notification
