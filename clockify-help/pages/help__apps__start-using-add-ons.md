# Start using add-ons

5 min read

To make the most of your CAKE.com and unlock its vast array of functionalities, you first need to ensure that you’re logged in with your [CAKE.com Marketplace account](https://developer.marketplace.cake.com/login/).   
If you’re visiting Marketplace from Clockify for the first time, you’ll be automatically logged in.

## Sign up for Clockify account [#](#sign-up-for-clockify-account)

If you haven’t signed up for a Clockify account yet, you can explore Clockify’s additional capabilities by creating a CAKE.com Marketplace account.  
First you need to create a Clockify account, with which you can subsequently log in to the CAKE.com Marketplace account.  
For all your additional logins, navigate to the **Manage accounts** page.

Keep in mind that your email account must be verified in order to access the Marketplace account.

## Log in [#](#log-in)

To log in to Clockify from the Marketplace, click the **Log in with Clockify** option and you’ll be redirected to Clockify’s login page. If you’re arriving from the specific [region](https://clockify.me/help/getting-started/data-regions) or [subdomain](https://clockify.me/help/getting-started/single-sign-on-sso#setting-up-custom-subdomain), the Marketplace will recognize it and perform an automatic login if your email address is verified.

## Install free add-ons [#](#install-free-add-ons)

Once you’ve selected the add-on you wish to install, an **Install** screen will appear if you’re an admin and already logged in with a compatible product.  
For newcomers, after creating your account, you’ll be redirected to this page to [log in](https://developer.marketplace.cake.com/login/). Admins, on the other hand, will be redirected to the [Log in with Clockify](https://marketplace.cake.com/login) screen where you’ll be guided to create an admin account granting you the power to install add-ons effortlessly.

In case you find yourself not logged in, don’t worry. After clicking the **Install** button, a screen will remind you to create an account with an admin user role.

Once logged in to the Clockify, you’ll jump to the **Add-on installation** screen and the workspaces you’re an admin on. Choose the desired workspace from the dropdown, or add one, if you’d like. After you add a new workspace, you will get to the **Manage accounts** screen, allowing additional adjustments and subsequent admin privileges for the workspace.

## Install paid add-ons [#](#install-paid-add-ons)

This part provides a guide on how to install paid add-ons, **per workspace**. This means that the installation and billing process is handled on a workspace level.

**Per seat** installation is coming soon. The add-ons installed **per seat** will be managed and billed based on individual users within a workspace.

### Install modal [#](#install-modal)

When the user is logged in at the product workspace they are compatible with, the install modal opens in the same way as for free add-ons:

* Paid add-ons
  + Flat pricing (monthly price displayed in the currency set up in the Settings on Clockify)
* After you click **Continue**, you’re redirected to **Install add-on** modal

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdY7QSNBmU_LBYJxhMo49a2kQ-UQdaZNtQP45QTiP1Uw-nDS3BkZjuCEl8JlsFkaTk7lot67I4GrvAkF-XO6fDlKO2ZbtwKhuiDN1OoiiSPNN3W6eO4NP2Pow2NpqTf1bSYz3ofld1ga7diE632HTroDhg?key=gwXsc9Vly0RemvZ53jG9Wg)

In case that the ws already has an add-on, you’ll get the info that there are no refunds and that the subscription will be renewed automatically and the subscription cancellation becomes effective with the next billing cycle.

### Information from customer [#](#information-from-customer)

Information on the customer contains the following information:

1. If customer already purchased an add-on
2. If customer has Clockify subscription (with or without Customer information – country, customer type)
3. If they are a first-time payer

![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdZY_eHehJS2QIdvqnc7-h4cyvbGUy2rJ8GjXzy_SdjQwhn2rF2XSDZHxtATRZizbBd9XuDheMTbUHtlU_A3glHQ7ezGaIZW5t7F-qnwNmPn4LyE9khnZsOz3WfpPCoAnvSosmQMr_ygilxZcgWG_TXWCg?key=gwXsc9Vly0RemvZ53jG9Wg)

If the user is the **first time payer** and already has a subscription to Clockify, there is already some information about them in the system. If paid add-on is installed successfully, confirmation email is sent to the workspace Admins.

## Install private add-ons [#](#install-private-add-ons)

To improve your integration’s security, you can create private add-ons directly in the Developer portal.

Remember to whitelist your Clockify workspace during the add-on release process.

To successfully install and use your private add-on, follow these steps:

1. Whitelist your Clockify workspace while creating private add-on in [developer portal](https://developer.marketplace.cake.com/login)
2. You’ll receive an email confirming the whitelisting, which includes a **View add-on** button
3. Click this button to be redirected to your private add-on’s preview page in the Marketplace (e.g. <https://marketplace.cake.com/addons/966b331c-6958-4dd9-a5ab-813cfa9811c5>)
4. Finally, click the **Install** button (just as you would with any publicly available add-on)
5. Choose your workspace to complete the installation

If you see a **This page doesn’t exist** error, make sure you’re logged into the [CAKE.com Marketplace](https://marketplace.cake.com/) with the correct Clockify account.

## Filled payment information [#](#filled-payment-information)

After the payment is finalized, all the customer and payment information will be filled out: **Customer info**, **Invoice info** and **Payment info**.

### Customer & payment info tab [#](#customer-payment-info-tab)

Information regarding customer & payment data can be edited at any point. However, only workspace owner can edit customer information.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/customer_and_payment_no-banner-1024x741.png)

Keep in mind that, in this step, you can change the **Country** even if you selected **Individual** as **Customer type**. This way, you can have two countries: one as a customer info and other in payment info modal.

### Things to remember: [#](#things-to-remember)

* If an add-on is already installed in a workspace, that workspace will be disabled in the dropdown
* For workspaces in specific regions, the add-on may not save data there due to the data protection regulations. *This means that Clockify doesn’t have an insight into where add-on data is stored. Add-ons might store data in regions different from the Workspace region.*

## Troubleshooting [#](#troubleshooting)

In the unlikely event of an error occurring during an installation process, an **Add-on maintenance** screen will appear notifying you that the installation is temporarily unavailable.
