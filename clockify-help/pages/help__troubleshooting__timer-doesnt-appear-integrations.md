# Timer doesn’t appear when using integrations

2 min read

If the timer isn’t showing up in tools like Asana, Trello, or Todoist while using Clockify, it’s often related to your browser setup, extension status, or how the integration is configured. Here’s how to check and resolve it.

Clockify currently supports Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browser extensions.

## Extension is not logged in [#](#extension-is-not-logged-in)

Even if the extension is installed on your browser, the timer won’t appear unless you are logged in.

To check that:

1. Click on the Clockify icon in the browser toolbar
2. Click on the Log In button
3. Confirm that you are logged in with the correct email address and workspace

## Browser or browser version is outdated [#](#browser-or-browser-version-is-outdated)

Supported browsers must be up to date for the extension to work properly.

How to check for updates:

* **Chrome**:

            Click the three-dot menu > Help > About Google Chrome > The browser will automatically check for updates

* **Edge**:

            Click the three-dot menu > Help and Feedback > About Microsoft Edge > Update if available

* **Firefox**:

            Click the three-line menu > Help > About Firefox > Firefox will check and install updates automatically

After updating, restart the browser to apply changes.
