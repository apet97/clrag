# How to delete all data

2 min read

Clockify does not have a single “delete everything” button, but you can remove data from different sections manually or use an add-on for bulk deletion.

Here’s how to delete data depending on your plan and needs:

## Delete time entries  [#](#delete-time-entries)

If you’re on a free plan:

1. Navigate to the **Detailed** report
2. Select the date range via the calendar
3. Click on the three dots next to each time entry and delete

You’ll need to delete entries one by one.

If you are on a paid plan:

1. Navigate to the **Detailed** report
2. Select the date range via the calendar
3. Click the checkbox at the top of the list next to the “time entry” text
4. Click **Delete** to remove them in bulk

This will only delete time entries visible on the current page. Repeat if needed.
