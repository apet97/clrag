# Profile settings

4 min read

Each user can set their preferences in the **Profile settings**. Settings are applied per-user basis.  
Meaning, the changes you make will affect only you:

* Rearrange items in your sidebar by drag and drop
* Move items you rarely use to the **Show more** section

Access **Profile settings** by clicking on your profile in the upper left corner.

In **Profile settings**, you can choose to manage:

* My profile
* Preferences

## My profile [#](#my-profile)

If you’d like to update your personal information, such as your email address, profile picture, or username, you can do so directly from your [CAKE.com Account](https://cake.com/help/introduction-to-cake-com/what-is-cake-com-productivity-suite/#cake-com-account). Simply click **Manage CAKE.com** **Account** in the **Profile settings**, and you’ll be redirected to your [CAKE.com Account page](https://account.cake.com/login) where you can make all the necessary changes.

To adjust a user’s **Week start**, [edit their profile](https://clockify.me/help/administration/edit-profiles) on the **Team** page.

#### Change language [#](#change-language)

In addition to English, you can also use Clockify in your native language (French, German, Spanish, Portuguese). Change the interface language in your [Profile settings](https://app.clockify.me/user/settings).

If you invite a new user to your workspace, they’ll inherit your language setting during signup. They can change if they want to.

Desktop and mobile apps take language based on the operating system (profile settings are only applied to the web version).

You can also unsubscribe from any type of email you receive by clicking **Unsubscribe** at the bottom of the email.
