# Manage scheduled projects

5 min read

Manage scheduled projects from the **Schedule** page and modify them according to your needs. Expand the project to see more details and information.

Scheduling is a paid feature, which you can enable by [upgrading](https://clockify.me/pricing) your workspace to the PRO or ENTERPRISE plan.

Scheduling can be performed by Admins. Project managers can only schedule their own projects.

See who is assigned to the scheduled project and the number of hours they are assigned to.

## Track project cost and billability [#](#track-project-cost-and-billability)

Along with seeing scheduled projects and tasks, you can also see cost and billable amount allocated to the project and/or task in question and financial resources needed for users assigned to work on them.

In order to see cost amount and billability for a project or task, **cost rate** and **billabile hours** need to be enabled in the [Workspace settings](https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/workspaces#workspace-settings).

### Enable cost rate & billability [#](#enable-cost-rate-billability)

To enable **billabile hours**:

1. Open **Workspace settings**
2. Switch to **Permissions** tab  
   ![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2024-10-28-at-16.04.13.png)
3. In **Billable hours section** enable **Activate billable hours**
4. Optionally set additional permissions of who can see hourly rates and amounts and billable status of the entries

To enable **cost rate**:

1. Open **Workspace settings**
2. In **Cost and profit analysis** enable **Activate cost rate**  
    ![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2024-10-28-at-15.15.00.png)
3. Additionally, **Workspace cost rate** field appears where you can set default cost rate of each tracked hour in your workspace

To enable **cost rate** and **billability**:

1. Open **Workspace settings**
2. In **General** tab, **Scheduling** section, enable **See billable cost and amount**

You can enable **cost rate** or **billable** **hours** or both depending on which of these options are already activated in the **Workspace settings**.

### See cost & billable amount [#](#see-cost-billable-amount)

If you’d like to see **cost amount** and **billable amount** for a certain project/task:

1. Navigate to the **Schedule** page in the sidebar
2. You’ll land on the **Projects** tab
3. Once you expand a project, you’ll see users with their corresponding assignments and time

The **Amount/Cost** column reflects totals of calculated billable and cost amounts, for that user, based on assignments, during the selected period. The same data is also displayed if you hover over the assignments whether they are published or not.   
Also, any time assignment rates are updated, all related totals will automatically refresh to reflect accurate values.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Screenshot-2024-10-28-at-16.06.13-1024x461.png)

Values are displayed in the number and currency format set up in the Workspace settings.

If you downgrade your subscription plan or disable cost & billable amount, Amount and Cost data won’t appear in the timeline.

**Important considerations:**

* If only **Billable rate** is activated, only **Amount** will be displayed
* If both rates are activated, both **Amount** and **Cost** will be visible
* If relevant rate is activated but not set, the value will be displayed as **0**

## Search project or client [#](#search-project-or-client)

Search for a particular project or client based on the dates when the projects were scheduled.

To do that:

1. Navigate to the top right corner of the page
2. Adjust the date range using the date picker
3. See assignments for a different time periods like this week, next month, or any custom period (e.g. next 30 days)  
   **The range can be from 1 week to a maximum of 8 weeks.**

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ElcqBHj6gYYj7fDsUTEyhgv-3KKj8hHdjqnGYzUmoTRIXhjyNMkKvHzS7A_6s6gU2h4Wa4cDZCThmTIcW6AHQ2FIfigcgKK1TcgJ0ccNcLr0AIyFmyxeGNVGu4PH4SWIdpaWECHlx7wtZ8ET7eYGVLQ)

Use arrows to navigate between previous and next time periods. Project blocks with an underline indicate a person is scheduled to work on that project all day. A red overline indicates they are over their capacity. Zoom in and out for a detailed view of assignments.

See total hours assigned for each project in the selected time range, displayed next to the project name.

* **Public** – Any member can be scheduled
* **Private** – Members need to be added before scheduling
* **Archived** – Only existing assignments are visible
