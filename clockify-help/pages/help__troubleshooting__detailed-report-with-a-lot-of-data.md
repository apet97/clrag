# Detailed report with a lot of data

1 min read

To fetch detailed time entry reports, use the following endpoint:

```
POST /v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}/reports/detailed
```

Add `page` and `pageSize` parameters to manage large datasets.

**Example**:

* `page: 1`
* `pageSize: 1000`

If you have more than 1000 entries, create a script or manually change the page number in the body (`page: 1`, `page: 2`, etc.).
