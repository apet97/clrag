# Is access to API documentation available on all subscription plans?

1 min read

Yes, the [Clockify API documentation](https://docs.clockify.me/) is available to all users, regardless of their subscription plan. However, there are certain limitations based on the permissions tied to your API key:

* **Free plans**: You will be able to access the API but may be restricted from using certain paid features (e.g. inviting users, creating projects, managing specific features)
* **Paid plans**: Full access to all features will be available through the API, depending on your workspace permissions
