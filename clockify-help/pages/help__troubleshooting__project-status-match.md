# Project status and reports don’t match

3 min read

If you’re seeing different numbers between the Project status page and the Detailed or Summary reports, here’s a breakdown of why the values may not match and how to interpret them correctly.

## Project status shows all-time totals [#](#project-status-shows-all-time-totals)

The Project status page always shows data from the start of the project to the current date. It does not respond to any date range filters.

What this means:

* If you run a report for last month, but the project started earlier, you’ll see a lower total in the report.
* The project status will show the full total from day one of the project.

How to match them more closely:

* Extend the report date range to cover the full project duration if you want to compare values.

## Time rounding doesn’t apply to project status [#](#time-rounding-doesnt-apply-to-project-status)

Time rounding rules set in Workspace settings only affect reports and exports, not the project status page.

What this means:

* If you’ve rounded time entries (e.g., to the nearest 6 minutes), reports will reflect that rounded value
* The project status page will use actual tracked time (unrounded), resulting in small differences

How to check:

* Open the Detailed report and turn off the rounding
* You’ll likely see values that more closely match the project status

## Invoiced time is not deducted from the project status [#](#invoiced-time-is-not-deducted-from-the-project-status)

Invoicing a time entry does not remove or subtract it from the project’s tracked time or progress.

What this means:

* If you’ve already invoiced 20 hours, you might expect those to be removed from the project
* They’ll still be counted in full as project status tracks total effort, not outstanding or un-invoiced time

## Project status is always displayed in decimal format [#](#project-status-is-always-displayed-in-decimal-format)

Regardless of how your workspace is configured (e.g., full, compact, or decimal format), the Project status page will always show time in decimal format.

What this means:

* If your report says 1h 30m, the Project status page will display that as 1.5h
* This is just a difference in formatting, not an error or miscalculation

Use the Detailed report in the decimal format if you want a side-by-side comparison that matches the project status format.
