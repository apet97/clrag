# Set up multiple currencies

2 min read

As an admin, you can define multiple currencies on your workspace and assign to a client the currency they are using. This way, client’s rates and amounts are displayed in their preferred currency.

Defining multiple currencies is available for admins on all subscription plans. Assigning a specific currency to a client is only possible with a **PRO** or higher subscription plan, including trial subscriptions.

Follow the instructions below to add new currency, change the default currency and effectively manage client-specific currencies.

## Add currency [#](#add-currency)

To add new currency:

1. Go to the **[Workspace settings](https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/workspaces#workspace-settings)**
2. Navigate to the **Currencies** section
3. Click **Edit** next tothe **Currencies** dropdown menu

In the **Edit currencies** screen that appears, edit the existing currency or click on **+Add currency** if you’d like to create a new one.

## Change default currency [#](#change-default-currency)

To change the default currency:

1. Go to the **[Workspace settings](https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/workspaces#workspace-settings)**
2. Navigate to the **Currencies** section
3. Choose one of the available currencies from the dropdown

If there is a defined currency assigned to a client, and that currency is deleted, the default one is automatically assigned to it. The default currency acts as a fallback option when the specific currency is missing or unavailable. **Default currency cannot be deleted.**

## Delete currency [#](#delete-currency)

To delete the defined currency:

1. Click **X** next to the currency you want to delete
2. Confirm the deletion in the screen that appears
3. Currency will be deleted accordingly
