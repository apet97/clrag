# Invite users & assign roles in your workspace

6 min read

Workspace Admins and Owners are responsible for managing users within their workspace. This includes inviting team members, assigning roles, and managing user profiles. With these capabilities, you can ensure your team has the proper access to track and manage time efficiently.

In this guide, we’ll walk you through the process of inviting users, assigning roles, and managing user settings to ensure your workspace is set up for success.

## Invite users to your workspace [#](#invite-users-to-your-workspace)

To get started, you’ll need to invite team members to your workspace, so they can track time. As an **Admin** or **Owner**, you’re the only ones who can invite users to the workspace.

Steps to invite users:

1. Go to the **Team** page
2. Depending on the type of member you’d like to add, go to **Full** or **Limited** tab
3. Click **Add full/limited member**
4. Enter the email addresses of the users you want to invite. You can invite multiple users at once by separating the emails with commas or by entering them one by one.  
   **Free plan**: You can invite up to 5 users at once  
   **Paid plan**: You can invite an unlimited number of users
5. Send invitation:
   * Click **Send invite** to send the invitations

Once the user accepts the invitation, they become a member of the workspace.

### Invite users manually [#](#invite-users-manually)

If you’ve added users but they haven’t received an email invitation, you can manually resend the invitation:

1. Go to the **Team** page
2. Click the **three dots** next to the user’s name
3. Select **Send an invite email**

Members can [sign up](https://app.clockify.me/en/signup) on their own and they’ll automatically be part of your workspace (if they have a pending invite).

## Accept the invite [#](#accept-the-invite)

Once invited, users will receive an email with an activation link.

To accept the invite:

1. Click the activation link in the email
2. **Verify email**: They’ll be asked to verify their email address
3. **Start tracking time**: After successful verification, they can log in and start tracking time within your workspace

If a member already has a Clockify account, they have to [log in](https://app.clockify.me/en/login) and accept the invite via the bell notification in the upper right corner.

## Manage user profiles [#](#manage-user-profiles)

As an Admin or Owner, you can edit team members’ profiles directly from the **Team** page. Here’s how:

1. Go to the **Team** page
2. Click the **three dots** next to the member’s name
3. Edit profile
   * Set their **week start**, **working days**, and **daily work capacity**

## Assign roles [#](#assign-roles)

You can assign different roles to users, giving them varying levels of access to your workspace.   
  
Here’s how to assign roles:

Make someone admin

Make someone owner

To make someone an admin:

1. Go to the **Team** page
2. Click **+Role** next to the user you want to make an Admin
3. Check the **Admin** box and click **Save**

Only the workspace Owner can remove the Admin role from someone.

Transfer ownership to another user via your CAKE.com account.

1. Open your **Profile settings** at the top right corner
2. Click the **Manage CAKE.com** account button
3. You’ll be redirected to your CAKE.com account
4. Go to the **Members** page
5. Click on the workspace member you’d like to transfer the ownership to
6. Open the three-dots menu in the top right corner
7. Choose **Transfer ownership**

Once the ownership is transferred, you’ll be downgraded to an Admin, and the new Owner will receive a notification.
