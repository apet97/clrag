# Check your assigned role

2 min read

In Clockify, user roles define the level of access and permissions you have within the workspace. Knowing your role provides a better insight into what you can and cannot do in Clockify.

Whether you’re an Admin, Manager, or Regular user, here’s how you can easily check your user role:

1. Open your browser and navigate to Clockify
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Once logged in, go to the **Team** page from the sidebar
4. You’ll find a list of all workspace members, including those with Full, Limited, and Group access
5. Here, you can see the role assigned to you within the workspace (e.g. Admin, Team Manager, Project Manager or User)

## User roles in Clockify [#](#user-roles-in-clockify)

* **Admin**: Full access to manage all aspects of the workspace, including user management, permissions, and billing
* **Manager**: Can manage teams, track time, and view reports, but cannot change workspace settings or billing
* **User**: Can track time and view reports but does not have permissions to manage teams or settings

If you don’t see the **Team** page in your sidebar, you may not have permission to view it. In that case, contact your workspace owner/admin or the person who invited you to the workspace.

You can check who that is in the workspace invitation email:
