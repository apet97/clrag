Clockify provides an all-in-one process for requesting time off, making it easier to manage your schedule and ensure team coordination. This guide walks you through the process of requesting time off in Clockify, including how to select the appropriate time off policy, specify your request details, and submit it for approval.

2. Click **Request time off**
3. Choose your time off policyIn the dropdown menu, select the time off policy you’d like to request. This will show you how many days/hours you have available for each policy.  
   If you don’t have enough balance and the policy doesn’t allow for negative balances, you won’t be able to select that policy.
4. Specify the dates for your requestSelect the **start** and **end date** for your time off. Holidays and weekends are automatically excluded from your total time off count, so you don’t need to manually adjust for those days.
5. Add a note (optional) toexplain your time off request to your manager or approver
6. Click **Submit**Your manager will receive a notification to review and approve (or reject) your request.

## Time off policies [#](#time-off-policies)

When requesting time off, the available policies and the amount of time you have left will be displayed in the dropdown menu. Your workspace may have multiple time off policies (e.g. vacation, sick leave), and each policy can have different rules for how much time off you’re entitled to and whether the policy allows negative balances.

Please note that:

* If you don’t have enough time left in the policy you choose, you will be unable to select it (unless the policy allows negative balances).
* You can view your available balance for each policy directly from the dropdown menu.

## Manage time off request [#](#manage-time-off-request)

You can manage your own time off requests from the **Time Off page**. This includes viewing the status of your requests (e.g., pending, approved, rejected) and making updates as needed.

### Withdraw time off [#](#withdraw-time-off)

If you realize you made a mistake or need to change your request, you can **withdraw** your pending request.

To withdraw:

1. Click on the three dots next to your request
2. Select **Withdraw**

On the **Time Off page**, you’ll be able to see all users in your workspace and their time off requests in the timeline. This way your team will have better coordination and less timetable overlappings.

## Email notifications [#](#email-notifications)

Clockify automatically sends email notifications for key actions related to time off requests, therefore, when your time off is approved or rejected you will receive an email indicating that.  
If you’d like to adjust your email preferences, go to the [Email notifications](https://clockify.me/help/administration/profile-settings#email-notifications) tab in your [Profile settings](https://clockify.me/help/administration/profile-settings).
