## Track cost and billability per user [#](#track-cost-and-billability-per-user)

Team tab allows you to track costs and billable amounts per user alongside scheduled projects and tasks.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-10-29-at-10.12.51-1024x461.png)

To view cost amounts and billability for a project or task, make sure both cost rate and **billable hours** are enabled in the Workspace settings. If either is disabled, you won’t see this information on the **Scheduling** page.

To enable **billabile hours** on a workspace:

1. Open **Workspace settings**
2. Switch to the **Permissions** tab
3. In the **Billable hours** section, enable **Activate billable hours**

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-10-29-at-10.49.38.png)

To enable **cost rate** on a workspace:

1. Open **Workspace settings**
2. In the **General** tab, **Cost and profit analysis** section, enable **Activate cost rate**

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-10-29-at-13.01.27-1024x410.png)

Additionally, a Workspace **cost rate** field will appear, allowing you to set the default cost rate for each tracked hour in your workspace.

Optionally, set additional permissions regarding who can view hourly rates, amounts, and the billable status of entries.

To enable **cost rate** and **billability** on **Schedule** page:

1. Open **Workspace settings**
2. In the **General** tab, under the **Scheduling** section, enable **See billable cost and amount**

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-10-29-at-10.54.35-1024x280.png)

To see total billable and cost amount per user:

1. Check the Amount/Cost column for totals
2. Expand users to see more details on scheduled projects/tasks

**Collapsed view**

* Assigned hours: Total hours assigned to each user
* Amount/Cost: Total cost data for each user, similar to the [Projects tab](https://clockify.me/help/projects/manage-scheduled-projects#track-project-cost-and-billability)

**Expanded view**

When expanded, the Amount/Cost column shows financial data for each project. If a user has multiple projects in different currencies, the default currency is shown first, followed by others in alphabetical order. Hovering over the notation reveals all amounts.

![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-10-29-at-11.02.05-1024x460.png)

### Daily and weekly capacity [#](#daily-and-weekly-capacity)

Use the Daily capacity option to see if users are under, over, or at full capacity for that day. Hovering shows Amount and Cost rates. This applies to the Weekly view as well, just on a weekly level.

Amount and cost values are displayed in the number and currency format set up in the Workspace settings.

If you downgrade your subscription plan or disable billability, Amount and Cost data won’t appear the timeline.

## Performance tracking [#](#performance-tracking)
