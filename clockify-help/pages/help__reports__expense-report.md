## See and manage tracked expenses [#](#see-and-manage-tracked-expenses)

To see all tracked expenses, open Expense report either from the sidebar, or by going to any Report and clicking on **Time report**, and selecting **Expense report**.

You can get the report for any date range you need by choosing the range in the upper left corner and choosing a predefined range or selecting a custom one.

You can filter the report by the following criteria: **billable** (billable, non-billable), **type** (time off, holiday, regular entry), **approval** (approved, unapproved) and **invoicing** (invoiced).

You can **sort** expenses by clicking on the column header in the table.

Expenses that are invoiced are marked as invoiced. Hover over the invoiced tag to see which invoice picked them up.

You can manually mark expenses as invoiced by selecting them via bulk edit and then choosing **Mark as invoiced**. To mark as uninvoiced, select only the invoiced expenses.

You can **export** all the expenses to PDF, CSV and Excel by clicking **Export**.

Once you downgrade your subscription from Enterprise or PRO to a lower plan, previously created expenses won’t be visible and cannot be exported anymore.

To edit or delete an expense, click on the three dots next to the expense.
