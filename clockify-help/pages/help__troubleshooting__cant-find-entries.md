# I can’t find my time entries

3 min read

If your time entries aren’t showing up, there could be a few different reasons behind it. Here’s how to check what might be happening and how to get your entries to show correctly.

## You’re logged into the wrong workspace  [#](#youre-logged-into-the-wrong-workspace)

Your time entries are tied to the workspace where you tracked them. If you are in a different workspace, you won’t see them.

What to do:

1. Click on the workspace switcher in the top-left corner
2. Switch to other available workspaces and check the Time Tracker or Reports

Your tracked time may be in a personal workspace or another team workspace.

## You are viewing the wrong date range [#](#you-are-viewing-the-wrong-date-range)

The entries may exist but be outside of the currently selected date range.

What to do:

1. Navigate to the Reports page (Summary or Detailed)
2. Check and adjust the date range via the calendar to include relevant dates

This is especially common when reviewing older or future time entries.

Reports always default to a weekly view.

## You are logged into a different account [#](#you-are-logged-into-a-different-account)

If you have multiple Clockify accounts with different email addresses, your time entries may be in another account entirely.

What to do:

1. Make sure you’re logged in with the same email address used to create or join the workspace
2. If you are not sure, check all your email inboxes for Clockify-related messages
3. If you’re part of a company workspace, ask an admin to confirm which email is tied to your profile on the Team page

If you’re signed in using an Apple ID with Private Relay, your account may use a private, anonymized email address (e.g., [random@privaterelay.appleid.com](mailto:random@privaterelay.appleid.com)). In that case, make sure you’re using the “Continue with Apple” option instead of trying to log in manually.

## Your time entries were deleted by an admin  [#](#your-time-entries-were-deleted-by-an-admin)

Admins have permission to delete time entries submitted by other users. If you’re a regular user, this might be the reason they’re missing.

What to do:

1. Contact your workspace admin to check if the entries were removed
2. If they were, and if your permissions allow it, you can enter time retroactively by changing the date on the Time Tracker page
