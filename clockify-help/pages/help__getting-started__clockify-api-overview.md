### Permissions & access control [#](#permissions-access-control)

API actions follow the same permission model as the Clockify UI. Only users with the appropriate roles and [access levels](https://clockify.me/help/administration/user-roles-and-permissions/who-can-do-what) in the app can perform specific actions via the API.
