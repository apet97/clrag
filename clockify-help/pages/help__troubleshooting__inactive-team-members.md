# How to view the time of inactive team members?

1 min read

You can still view the time tracked by team members who are no longer active in your workspace.

**If the team member is deactivated:**

1. Go to any report (Summary or Detailed)
2. Open the Team filter
3. Select “Inactive” to include deactivated users
4. Find the team member by name to view their time entries

**If the team member is deleted:**

1. Go to the Summary report
2. Use the Group by -> User option
3. Scroll through the grouped list and find users as DeletedUser
4. Click on it to open a Detailed report where you can see all their time entries

If you delete a user completely from your organization, their name will no longer appear in reports or entries. They’ll be listed as DeletedUser. To preserve historical data while still freeing up their seat, we recommend deactivating the user instead of deleting them.
