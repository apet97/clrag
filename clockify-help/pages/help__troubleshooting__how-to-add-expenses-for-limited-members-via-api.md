## Add expenses for Limited members [#](#add-expenses-for-limited-members)

* **Get user IDs of Limited members**:  
  + Since the `GET /workspaces/{workspaceId}/users` endpoint does not provide information about Limited members, you need to extract the **user IDs** from the user groups endpoint
* **Get the category ID for the expense**:  
  + Use the following endpoint to get the category ID:
    - `GET /workspaces/{workspaceId}/expenses/categories`
  + Make sure to choose the correct category for the expense
* **Create the expense**:  
  + Once you have the category ID, you can create an expense using the following endpoint:
    - `POST /workspaces/{workspaceId}/expenses`
  + Remember to send the request in **form-data format**, not raw JSON format
  + Include the user ID of the Limited member, category ID, and other expense details in the body

If the request is successful, you will receive a `201 Created` status code.  
The expense will be created for the Limited member as expected.
