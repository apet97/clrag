5 min read

This guide provides an overview of the **signup** and **login** processes for new **Admins** and **Owners** of Clockify accounts. Whether you’re new to Clockify or managing an existing account, this article will walk you through the steps to get started and access your workspace.

## Sign up for Clockify [#](#sign-up-for-clockify)

If you’re new to Clockify and would like to start using the app, you’ll need to create a Clockify account. Here’s how:

1. Navigate to<https://clockify.me>
2. Click the **Sign up free** button to begin the registration process
3. Enter your **email address** and review the **Terms and conditions**
4. Click **Accept** to proceed
5. You will receive an email with a **verification code** to confirm your email address
6. Enter the **verification code** to complete your registration.

After verifying your email, you’ll be redirected to the **Time tracker** page of your new workspace, and you can begin tracking time right away.

You’ll also receive a **Welcome email** containing helpful tips and links to **onboarding tutorials** to guide you through your Clockify experience.

**Choose your language**: Before completing the signup process, you can choose your preferred language from the dropdown.

## Continue with Google [#](#continue-with-google)

If you prefer to use your Google account, you can sign up directly with your **Google credentials**.

1. On the signup screen, select **Continue with Google**
2. If you have multiple email addresses linked to your Google account, you’ll be prompted to choose one
3. Once you’ve chosen your email, you’ll be redirected to your new Clockify workspace where you can start using the app right away

## Log in to Clockify [#](#log-in-to-clockify)

If you already have a Clockify account, you can easily log in using the following steps:

1. Visit<https://clockify.me>
2. Enter your **email address** associated with your Clockify account
3. Click **Continue with Email**
4. You’ll receive a **verification code** in your inbox
5. Enter the 6-character verification code (numbers and letters) in the verification screen   
   The code expires after **30 seconds**, so make sure to enter it quickly.

Once the code is verified, you’ll be automatically logged in and redirected to the **Time tracker** page.

## Troubleshooting [#](#troubleshooting)

If you encounter any issues while logging in, here are a few things to keep in mind:

If, during the login process, you mistakenly entered a new email address that is not linked to an existing Clockify account, you will be redirected to the **signup screen**. You can then complete the signup process and create a new Clockify account with that email address.

### Failed login attempts [#](#failed-login-attempts)

* If you enter the wrong login details **5 times in a row**, your account will be locked for **24 hours** to prevent unauthorized access.
* You will receive an email notifying you of the lockout. You can manually unlock your account before the 24-hour period is over to continue with the login process.

## Single sign-on (SSO) login [#](#single-sign-on-sso-login)

If you want to avoid entering your login credentials each time, you can set up **Single Sign-On (SSO)** to connect Clockify with your organization’s identity provider. This allows you to sign in automatically without needing to enter your credentials manually.

This feature is available on the [Enterprise](https://clockify.me/help/administration/subscription-plans#enterprise) subscription plan.

### Set up SSO [#](#set-up-sso)

* You can configure **SSO** by linking the Clockify subdomain to an identity provider (like **Google Workspace**, **Okta**, etc.).
* Once SSO is configured, users can sign in to Clockify using their organization’s SSO credentials.

## FAQ [#](#faq)

* You’ll be automatically redirected to your newly created workspace

#### What happens if I enter the wrong email or password during login? [#](#what-happens-if-i-enter-the-wrong-email-or-password-during-login)

If you fail to log in with the correct credentials 5 times in a row, your account will be locked for **24 hours**. You’ll receive an email with instructions to manually unlock your account before the 24-hour lock expires.

#### What is a verification code and how long is it valid? [#](#what-is-a-verification-code-and-how-long-is-it-valid)

A **verification code** is a 6-character code (numbers and letters) sent to your email when you sign up or log in. The code is valid for **30 seconds** and needs to be entered promptly to complete the verification process.

#### What if I forget my email or can’t find my verification email? [#](#what-if-i-forget-my-email-or-cant-find-my-verification-email)

If you can’t find the verification email, make sure to check your **spam** or **junk** folder. If you still can’t find it, request a new verification email by clicking the **Resend verification** link.

#### Can I log in using single sign-on (SSO)? [#](#can-i-log-in-using-single-sign-on-sso)

Yes, if your workspace is connected to an identity provider, you can log in using **SSO** (Single Sign-On). This allows you to skip entering your login credentials each time you access Clockify. Admins can set up SSO from the **Workspace settings**.

#### What happens if I try to log in with an email address that is not associated with my account? [#](#what-happens-if-i-try-to-log-in-with-an-email-address-that-is-not-associated-with-my-account)

#### What is the SSO login process? [#](#what-is-the-sso-login-process)

Admins can set up **Single Sign-On (SSO)** by linking Clockify to an identity provider like **Google Workspace**, **Okta**, or **Microsoft Azure AD**. Once SSO is enabled, users can log in directly using their organization’s SSO credentials, bypassing the need for separate login details.

#### What should I do if my account is locked? [#](#what-should-i-do-if-my-account-is-locked)

If your account is locked due to multiple failed login attempts:

* You’ll receive an email notifying you of the lockout
* You can manually unlock your account by following the instructions in the email. The lock will automatically expire in 24 hours.

#### Can I use multiple accounts with Clockify? [#](#can-i-use-multiple-accounts-with-clockify)

Yes, Clockify allows you to create and manage multiple workspaces. If you have different accounts or workspaces, you’ll need to log in separately to each one. You can switch between them from the workspace selector if you’re logged into multiple accounts.
