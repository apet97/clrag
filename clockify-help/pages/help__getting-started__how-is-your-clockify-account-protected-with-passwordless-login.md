# Passwordless login in Clockify

2 min read

**Passwordless login** is an authentication method that completely removes the need for passwords. Instead of entering a password, you need to authenticate yourself by using **OTP (one-time password)** code sent to your email address.

## How passwordless login works in Clockify [#](#how-passwordless-login-works-in-clockify)

1. Enter your email address in the Clockify login page
2. OTP code is sent to your email address
3. Enter OTP code in the designated fields in the login page
4. After authentication, you’ll be automatically logged in to your Clockify account

If you’re not receiving verification emails, it might be due to too many unused OTP codes. To fix this, simply open the last verification email and click the **click here** button to start receiving emails again. Always use your login code within 30 minutes to avoid this issue in the future.

## Benefits of passwordless login [#](#benefits-of-passwordless-login)

**Passwordless login** offers improved security compared to traditional password-based authentication and several more advantages:

* **Convenience**  
  No need to remember or type a password. Just a single action (entering an OTP code) grants access
* **Increased security**  
  Without passwords, you eliminate common password-related security risks:
  + Password reuse (using the same password across multiple sites)
  + Phishing attacks (tricking users into entering their password on a fake site)
  + Weak or stolen passwords
* **Lower risk of account compromise**  
  As there are no passwords involved, there is no risk of a password being leaked, guessed, or stolen through brute-force attacks.

Many large corporations are adopting passwordless login because it’s safer and provides a better experience for users. It helps protect your account from common threats while making logging in easier and faster.
