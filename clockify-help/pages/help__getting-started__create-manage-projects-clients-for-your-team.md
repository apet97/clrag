# Create & manage projects & clients for your team

4 min read

Learn how to create, manage, and organize projects and clients in **Clockify**.

## Create projects [#](#create-projects)

Projects help categorize and track time entries for specific tasks. Each project is typically assigned to a client, though you can create clientless projects for internal use.

#### Steps to create a project: [#](#steps-to-create-a-project)

1. Go to the **Projects** page and click **Create new project**
2. Name the project
3. Select an existing **Client** or create a new one by typing a name and clicking **Create Client**
4. Choose a **Project color** and set the **Visibility** (Public or Private)
5. Click **Create**

Once created, you can assign tasks and start tracking time for the project.

### Quick create [#](#quick-create)

When adding a time entry, click the **+Project** field, type the project name, and select **Create new project**.

## Manage projects [#](#manage-projects)

### Archive projects [#](#archive-projects)

Once a project is completed, you can **archive** it to keep it out of the way during time tracking. Archived projects remain in reports.

#### Steps to archive [#](#steps-to-archive)

1. Go to **Projects** and click the **three dots** next to the project
2. Select **Archive**

To **restore** an archived project, click the **three dots** and select **Restore**.

### Delete projects [#](#delete-projects)

Projects can only be deleted once archived. Be aware that deleting a project removes it from time entries but leaves the time data intact.

#### Steps to delete [#](#steps-to-delete)

1. Go to **Projects** and select **Archived** from the filter
2. Click the **three dots** next to the project and select **Delete**

## Set project billable rates [#](#set-project-billable-rates)

You can set a **billable rate** for each project, which applies to all time entries associated with that project.

Steps to set a billable rate:

1. Go to the **Projects** page and click on the project name
2. Switch to the **Project settings** tab
3. Set the **Billable rate** for the project

## Create clients [#](#create-clients)

Clients are necessary to link to projects, though they can exist without a project.

#### Steps to create a client: [#](#steps-to-create-a-client)

1. Go to the **Clients** page
2. Enter the client’s name and click **Add**

As a **Manager**, you can create clients when creating a project, but you won’t have access to the **Clients** page unless you’re an Admin.

## Assign tasks to projects [#](#assign-tasks-to-projects)

Tasks help you break down the work within a project. You can add new tasks, assign them to users, and set deadlines.

#### Steps to add a task: [#](#steps-to-add-a-task)

1. Go to the **Projects** page and select the desired project
2. In the **Tasks** tab, enter the name of the task in the **Add new task** field
3. Click **Add**
4. Set assignees, billability, rates and other details

## Filter and sort projects [#](#filter-and-sort-projects)

With many projects, filters and sorting options help you stay organized.

Filter projects by **Status** (Active, Archived), **Client**, **User**, and **Billability.**

Sort projects byclicking on **Name**, **Client**, or **Status** to sort projects alphabetically.

## Set project templates [#](#set-project-templates)

If you manage multiple similar projects, creating a template can save you time. Templates pre-define settings like billable rates, tasks, and estimates.

#### Steps to set a project template: [#](#steps-to-set-a-project-template)

1. Go to the **Projects** page
2. Open the **three-dot menu** next to the project’s name
3. Choose **Set as template**

## Role permissions for Managers [#](#role-permissions-for-managers)

As a **Project manager**, you can:

* Create, edit, archive, and restore projects
* Add and modify tasks, assign them, and track progress
* Change project visibility (public/private)
* Add/remove members from projects
* Set billable rates for projects and tasks

As a **Team manager**, you have similar permissions but without the ability to manage project settings like billable rates or templates.

## FAQ [#](#faq)

   * Set up billability or project rate
   * Set up project estimate
   * Add any additional fields that would help you track time more efficiently

#### Can I delete a project right after creating it?  [#](#can-i-delete-a-project-right-after-creating-it)

No, projects can only be deleted after being archived.
