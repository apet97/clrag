# Schedule team assignments

3 min read

Scheduling team assignments helps you plan projects easily by providing a visual timeline of your team’s availability. This way, you can easily see who’s working on a project/task.

Scheduling is a paid feature, which you can enable by [upgrading](https://clockify.me/pricing) your workspace to the PRO or ENTERPRISE plan.

### Navigate team capacity with Team view [#](#navigate-team-capacity-with-team-view)

Team view provides a quick overview of your team’s capacity, indicating who’s available and who’s overbooked. Project and team views use the same assignment data, allowing you to plan and organize work more efficiently.

If they have permissions to create assignments, Regular users and Team managers only have a **Team** view on the **Schedule** page.

## Add and manage team members [#](#add-and-manage-team-members)

To add new team member:

1. Open the **Schedule** page
2. Choose **Team** page
3. Click **Add member** to introduce a new team member

This action loads the user and displays all their assignments if available.

Assign tasks to **active**, **inactive** and **invited** users.

Use the **Team** menu to filter assignments based on users and groups.

## Hide team members [#](#hide-team-members)

As an Owner/Admin, you have the option to hide team members from the **Team** tab on the **Schedule** page.

**Team** page provides the following information:

* Total hours assigned to each member in the selected time range
* See each team member’s schedule in detail
* Detect time off periods in user’s timeline
* Identify overcapacity if there are assignments during time off

You can customize and choose how to display a team member’s capacity on the **Team** page. Depending on the set time range, it can be displayed on a daily or weekly basis.

## Performance tracking [#](#performance-tracking)
