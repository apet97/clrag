# Not receiving project estimate alerts

3 min read

If you’ve set up a time or budget estimate on a project or a task but aren’t receiving alerts when the threshold is crossed, here’s how to troubleshoot the issue and ensure alerts are properly delivered.

## Alerts are not sent immediately  [#](#alerts-are-not-sent-immediately)

Estimate alerts are sent approximately 30 minutes after the threshold is reached, meaning that if your estimate is set to trigger at 80%, an alert won’t appear instantly. It will typically be delivered via email within 30-40 minutes.

## Alerts are only sent once per threshold [#](#alerts-are-only-sent-once-per-threshold)

Clockify sends a single alert when the estimate threshold is reached, for example, 80% or 100%. If your tracked time jumps rapidly past multiple thresholds, you’ll only receive the alert for the highest one reached, not for the lower thresholds passed.

## Workspace alert rules may be misconfigured  [#](#workspace-alert-rules-may-be-misconfigured)

Admins define who receives alerts and when they are sent. If no alert rules exist or the wrong group is selected, notifications won’t go out.

How to check (Admins):

1. Click on the three dots next to the Workspace name
2. Select “Workspace settings”
3. Navigate to the Alerts tab
4. Review the rules and confirm which group is selected:

* Admins
* Project Managers
* Project Members

You can define multiple rules that include all groups by clicking on the “Add” button.

## Your role doesn’t match the alert rule [#](#your-role-doesnt-match-the-alert-rule)

Even if you are a part of the workspace, you won’t receive alerts unless your role matches the selected rule.

Examples:

* If the rule says Project managers, you must be assigned as a project manager on that project.
* If the rule says Project members, you must be added to the project access list.

How to verify:

* For Project Managers:

1. Navigate to the Projects page from the sidebar
2. Check the list of projects for that specific project

Clockify only shows you the projects you are officially assigned to manage.

* For regular users (verified by Admins or Project Managers)

1. Navigate to the Projects page from the sidebar
2. Click on the project to open it
3. Go to the Access tab
4. Check if the team member in question is listed under the “Members” section

## Your personal email preferences may be disabled [#](#your-personal-email-preferences-may-be-disabled)

Even if the alert rules are correct, you won’t receive alerts if you’ve disabled them in your email preferences.

1. Click on your profile picture located in the upper-right corner and select “Preferences”
2. Navigate to the “Email Preferences” tab
3. Make sure “Alerts” option is selected
