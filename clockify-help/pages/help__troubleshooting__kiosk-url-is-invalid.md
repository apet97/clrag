# Kiosk URL is invalid

2 min read

Sometimes, when trying to launch a kiosk, you might run into an error stating that the URL is invalid. This can happen for a few different reasons, most of them easy to fix with a quick settings check or adjustment.

## Deactivate the kiosk [#](#deactivate-the-kiosk)

If you’re seeing an invalid URL error, refreshing the kiosk might resolve it.

To do this:

1. Go to the kiosks page from the sidebar
2. Click on the three dots next to the kiosk and select Deactivate
3. Use the filter to show inactive kiosks
4. Click the three dots again and select Activate
5. Copy the kiosk link and try launching it again

## Kiosk name contains unsupported characters [#](#kiosk-name-contains-unsupported-characters)

Special characters like slashes (/) or symbols (! @ #) in the kiosk name can break the URL.

Solution:

1. On the Kiosks page, click the three dots next to the kiosk
2. Select Edit
3. Remove or replace special characters in the kiosk name
4. Save changes and use the updated link

## Browser issues [#](#browser-issues)

Cache, cookies, or browser settings may cause loading issues even with a valid URL.

Solution:

* Try launching the kiosk in an incognito/private window.
* Update the browser and relaunch
* Clear the cache and cookies from the browser
