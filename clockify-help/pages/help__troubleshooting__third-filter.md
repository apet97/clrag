# The third filter after Description is missing

1 min read

The summary report allows up to three grouping filters. However:

* You won’t be able to use Description as the first grouping filter
* If you select Description as the second filter, the third option becomes unavailable

## Why this happens [#](#why-this-happens)

Description represents the lowest data level in the hierarchy. Since it’s attached to each time entry individually, it doesn’t group or summarize data; there is nothing meaningful to break down further, which is why additional grouping isn’t allowed after it.

## Recommended solution [#](#recommended-solution)

Always use Description as the third filter when grouping data in the Summary Report. This keeps the report structured and ensures all grouping levels function correctly.
