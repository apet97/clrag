# Required fields

1 min read

You can prevent users from adding incomplete time entries by using required fields. This will ensure that all time entries have a mandatory minimum amount of information assigned to them, so your reports are organized and accurate at all times.

Required fields is a paid feature, which you can enable by [upgrading](https://clockify.me/pricing) your workspace to any of the paid plans.

## How to enable required fields [#](#how-to-enable-required-fields)

On the Workspace Settings page, administrators can define which fields on a time entry are mandatory before the time entry can be created.

You can make these fields mandatory:

* Project
* Task
* Tag
* Description

When the task is a required field, projects that don’t have tasks don’t show up in the project picker.

## How it works [#](#how-it-works)

For example, if you check project and tags as required:

* No one can add a time entry without a project and tag (not even admins)
* The timer can be started but can’t be stopped until you add a project and tag
* Timesheet won’t let you add time without selecting a tag
