# Admins & owners

3 min read

Clockify has two types of user roles in the **Administrative** category:

* **Owner**: User who created the workspace
* **Admin**: User with administrative permissions

## Role overview [#](#role-overview)

**Admin** vs **Owner**:

If the Owner leaves the workspace, the entire workspace is deleted

Admins can appoint users as [Managers](https://clockify.me/help/administration/user-roles-and-permissions/manager-role), who have additional project and team management permissions.  
Admins have a range of capabilities, including assigning roles, editing subscription payment information, managing groups, inviting users, setting user statuses, defining billable rates, overseeing time entries, scheduling projects and more.   
However, admins have some limitations, especially when it comes to managing subscriptions and payment details.

Below is a detailed breakdown of admin permissions:

| Action | Permission |

## Subscription and payment permissions [#](#subscription-and-payment-permissions)

While admins have many privileges in Clockify, **they do not have full access to subscription or payment-related information** if the workspace has an active subscription.   
  
Specifically:

* **Admins** can access the **Subscription** page and the **Payment tab**, but they **cannot** edit **Customer information**, **Invoice information**, or **Subscription payment information**
* Admins **can** see **Customer and Invoice information**, but they **cannot** make any changes to them
* Admins have the ability to **add or remove full and limited seats** in the workspace, but **cannot remove bundle seats** or limited seats on a **Bundle plan**
* Admins can **cancel** or **reactivate** a subscription, and they can **download and pay invoices**
* Admins can access the **Plans tab** and make decisions to **upgrade** or **downgrade** the workspace plan, but they do not have access to the detailed payment information itself

Only the **Owner** can edit subscription payment details, manage customer information, and perform all other administrative tasks related to billing and payment.
