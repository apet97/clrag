# Project or Team Managers can’t see or approve timesheets

2 min read

If Project or Team Managers don’t have access to timesheets or can’t approve them, the issue typically relates to the workspace settings or how their role is configured. Here’s how to identify what’s preventing access.

## Approval permissions are not enabled for the manager’s role [#](#approval-permissions-are-not-enabled-for-the-managers-role)

Project or Team Managers can only approve timesheets if the workspace is configured to allow it.

To check the workspace approval setup:

1. Click on the three dots next to the workspace name
2. Select “Workspace settings”
3. Navigate to the Permissions tab
4. Review the setting under the “Who can approve timesheets and expenses”

* If it’s set to Admins and Project Managers, only Admins and PMs can approve
* If it’s set to Admins and Team Managers, only Admins and TMs can approve

If the wrong approval group is selected, the manager won’t see any approval options even if they’re assigned to projects or teams.

## The manager is not assigned to the relevant projects or users  [#](#the-manager-is-not-assigned-to-the-relevant-projects-or-users)

* Project Managers will only receive timesheets containing entries for the projects they manage.
* Team Managers will only receive timesheets from users they manage.

To verify management assignments:

1. Navigate to the Team page
2. Find the manager in question and click on their role title
3. Under the Project Manager or Team Manager role, click to open the list of assigned projects or team members
4. Make sure the correct projects or users are selected

## Timesheets have already been approved by an Admin [#](#timesheets-have-already-been-approved-by-an-admin)

Admins can approve any timesheet, regardless of project or team. Once a timesheet is approved by an Admin, it cannot be approved again by Project or Team Manager.

In this case, the approval option will no longer be available for Project or Team Managers because the timesheet is already approved. You can find those timesheets under the “Archive” tab on the Approvals page.
