# API & webhook settings

4 min read

This feature is available to all users on all subscription plans.

Clockify allows you to manage and configure advanced settings for your profile such as **webhooks** and **API keys**. This way get more control over your account’s security and efficiency.

## API keys [#](#api-keys)

It’s important to save your API keys in a secure place. If you lose a key, or don’t save it, generating a new one will deactivate the old key, potentially breaking existing setups and integrations.   
In Clockify, you can save your API keys and edit them, as needed.

Find your API key settings in the **Advanced** tab of your **Profile settings**.

Here, you can manage your API keys in a few different ways.
