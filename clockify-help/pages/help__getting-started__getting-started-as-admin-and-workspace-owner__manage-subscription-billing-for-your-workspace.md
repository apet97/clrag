# Manage subscription & billing for your workspace

6 min read

As a Workspace Admin or Owner, managing your workspace’s subscription and billing settings is essential for accessing paid features and ensuring your team’s needs are met. In this guide, we’ll walk you through the process of managing subscriptions, upgrading or downgrading plans, and understanding billing cycles and user seats.

## Key concepts [#](#key-concepts)

Before diving into subscription management, it’s important to get familiar with some key concepts:

* **User seats**: Each active user in your workspace occupies a “seat.” You’re charged based on the number of active seats in your workspace, regardless of the user’s role or features
* **Bundle seats**: If you’re subscribed to the [CAKE.com Productivity Suite](https://cake.com/help/introduction-to-cake-com/what-is-cake-com-productivity-suite/), you may have additional bundle seats across different apps (Clockify, Pumble, Plaky)
* **Full & limited users**:  
  + **Full users**: Team members with complete access to the workspace
  + **Limited users**: Team members with restricted access, mainly for clocking in and out. These users may be charged with some additional fees.

## Billing & user seats [#](#billing-user-seats)

### Overview [#](#overview)

* You are charged for the total number of **active** user seats in your workspace, regardless of whether they are actively using the features
* If a user is **deactivated**, you can free up their seat and invite another user to take it
* You must buy a seat for each active user in your workspace

### Manage user seats [#](#manage-user-seats)

To ensure you have enough user seats available:

* If you run out of available seats, you can purchase more via the **Subscription** page
* Vacant seats can be removed, but once removed, they cannot be refunded

Only Workspace Owners and Admins can manage subscriptions, including adding and removing user seats.

## Navigate Subscription page [#](#navigate-subscription-page)

Your **Subscription page** is where you manage all billing-related settings, including your current plan, user seats, and payment information.

There are three key tabs:

* **Billing**:  
  + Tracks your current subscription plan, the number of used vs. available seats, and your billing information
  + A progress bar shows how many seats are in use (blue for available, red for unavailable)
* **Invoices**:  
  + View all past invoices and billing statements for your workspace
  + You can download invoices for future reference
* **Plans**:  
  + View available subscription plans and the option to upgrade or downgrade

## Subscription billing intervals [#](#subscription-billing-intervals)

You can choose your preferred billing cycle:

* **Annual billing**: Pay once a year and get a **discount** on your total bill
* **Monthly billing**: Pay on a month-to-month basis

### Switching between billing intervals [#](#switching-between-billing-intervals)

You can switch between monthly and annual billing cycles at any time from the **Subscription page**:

* **Annual to monthly**: You’ll switch after the current year ends
* **Monthly to annual**: You’ll be charged a prorated price, adjusting for the time left on your current plan

## Upgrade your subscription [#](#upgrade-your-subscription)

If you need more features or seats than your current plan offers, you can **upgrade** your subscription.

To upgrade:

1. Go to the **Subscription** page
2. Switch to the **Plans** tab
3. Click **Upgrade** beneath the plan you want
4. Select your **billing period** and confirm your upgrade

When you upgrade, you’ll be charged a **prorated price** for the new plan. Your user seat count will remain unchanged, but you’ll gain access to additional features.

## Downgrade your subscription [#](#downgrade-your-subscription)

If you find you don’t need as many features, you can **downgrade** to a lower-tier plan.

To downgrade:

1. Go to the **Subscription** page
2. Switch to the **Plans** tab
3. Click **Downgrade** below the plan you want
4. Confirm the action

Downgrading removes access to any additional features from your higher-tier plan. You’ll retain your data, but your access to premium features will end when the current subscription period finishes.

## Cancel or reactivate your subscription [#](#cancel-or-reactivate-your-subscription)

You can cancel your subscription at any time. If you later wish to return, you can reactivate it.

To cancel subscription:

1. Go to the **Billing** tab
2. Navigate to the right side of the screen and click **Cancel subscription**
3. Confirm your decision

After canceling:

* No further charges will be made
* You can still download your past invoices
* You can continue using premium features until the end of your billing period
* After the paid period ends, your workspace will automatically switch to the **Free plan**

To reactivate your subscription, go back to the **Subscription** page and follow the prompts to restart your subscription.

## Download invoices [#](#download-invoices)

If you need a record of your billing history:

1. Go to the **Subscription** page
2. Switch to the **Invoices** tab
3. Download any past invoices by selecting the appropriate statement

## FAQ [#](#faq)

#### How is billing calculated? [#](#how-is-billing-calculated)

You are billed for the total number of **active user seats** in your workspace, regardless of the roles or features used. If a user is deactivated, their seat becomes available for another user.

#### Can I add more seats after upgrading my plan? [#](#can-i-add-more-seats-after-upgrading-my-plan)

Yes, you can always add more user seats through the **Subscription** page. When you add seats, you will be charged based on the prorated cost for the remaining billing period.

#### What happens if I downgrade my subscription? [#](#what-happens-if-i-downgrade-my-subscription)

Downgrading removes access to any additional features you were using in the higher-tier plan, but your data will remain intact. You’ll lose access to premium features once the current subscription period ends.

#### Can I cancel my subscription? [#](#can-i-cancel-my-subscription)

Yes, you can cancel your subscription at any time. After canceling, you can continue using premium features until the end of your billing period, after which you will be downgraded to the Free plan.

#### Can I get a refund for unused seats? [#](#can-i-get-a-refund-for-unused-seats)

No, Clockify does not provide refunds for removed user seats. You can only free up seats by deactivating users, and then you can add new users to occupy those seats.
