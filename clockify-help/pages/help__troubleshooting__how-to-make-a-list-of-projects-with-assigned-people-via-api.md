# How to make a list of projects with assigned people via API?

1 min read

If you want to create a list of projects with the people assigned to them, do the following:

* **Tools**:  
  + You will need Postman (or another API tool) for making API calls
  + Convert JSON responses into CSV format for easier handling in Excel (e.g. use [konklone](https://konklone.io/json/), or some other conversion tool)
* **API calls**:  
  + Use the following two endpoints:
    - `GET /v1/users` – To get user information
    - `GET /v1/projects` – To get project information
  + Be mindful of the **page size** and **page number** when fetching project data to ensure you retrieve all projects
* **Convert data to CSV**:  
  + In **Postman**, export the responses to JSON
  + Use **konklone.io** to convert each JSON response to a CSV file
* **Combine data in Excel**:  
  + Open the two CSV files in **Excel**
  + Use **Excel’s conditional formatting** to match the user IDs in the project CSV with the corresponding user names (or emails) from the user CSV
  + You may need to adjust cell sizes to view all data or separate the user IDs into multiple cells

As a result,you’ll have a CSV file listing **projects** in one column and the assigned **user names** in another column.
