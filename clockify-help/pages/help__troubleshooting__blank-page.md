## Whitelist Clockify domains and IP addresses [#](#whitelist-clockify-domains-and-ip-addresses)

If you’re using a restricted network (e.g., corporate or secure office network), you may need to whitelist specific Clockify domains to allow the login page to load properly.

Make sure the following domains and IPs are allowed in your firewall or network settings:

* img.clockify.me
* api.clockify.me
* global.api.clockify.me
* reports.api.clockify.me
* stomp.clockify.me
* IP address: 198.2.128.220

**How to whitelist**

1. Identify where to manage network access (firewall, proxy, security software, etc.)
2. Add the domains and IP addresses listed above to your allowed list
3. Save the changes and refresh the login page
