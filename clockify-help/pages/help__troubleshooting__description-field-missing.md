# Description field missing in the Timesheet

1 min read

In the Timesheet view, you won’t see the description field by default. This view is designed for fast time input across the week.

But you can still add a description (and more details) after creating an entry. Here’s how:

**Add your time normally**



* Select a project and a task
* Enter your hours directly into the timesheet cells

**Click on the three dots in the cell**



* Once the entry is created, click on the three dots in the cell
* A detailed pop-up will open

**Add your description and other details**



      In the pop-up window, you can:

* Add a description
* Set start and end times
* Add tags
* Add other time entry details

Descriptions are linked to individual time entries. If you enter the same project across multiple rows, you’ll need to add a description to each entry separately if needed. If you prefer to add a description while creating the entry, use the Time Tracker page instead.
