# Historical rates

1 min read

Apply new rates retroactively to previous time entries in bulk when updating hourly rates (members’ rates defined in the Team page for each user).

Updating historic rates is a paid feature, which you can use by [upgrading](https://clockify.me/pricing) your workspace to any of the paid plans.

When you edit some hourly rate, you can apply the new rate:

* Apply **only to new** time entries onwards (e.g. someone got a raise or you increased price starting today)
* Apply to entries **from some specific date** onwards (e.g. you made a deal to increase rate from May 2022 onwards)
* Apply to **all past and future** time entries (e.g. the old rate was wrong)
