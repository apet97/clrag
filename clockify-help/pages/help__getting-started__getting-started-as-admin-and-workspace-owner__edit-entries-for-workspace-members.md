To add or edit time for a team member’s timesheet, follow these steps:

6. Save changes

If you do not see the **Timesheet** page in your sidebar, it may need to be enabled in your workspace **Settings**.

### Add time from Detailed reports [#](#add-time-from-detailed-reports)

For more control over time entries, you can add time for a team member directly from the **Detailed reports** page using the **Add time for others** option.

**Add time for others** is a paid feature available on [Basic](https://clockify.me/help/administration/subscription-plans#basic) subscription plan and above.

#### To add time from **Detailed** reports:

1. Hover over **Reports** in the sidebar and select **Detailed**
2. Click the **Add time for others** button at the top of the page
3. Click **Select user** and choose individual team members or user groups for whom you wish to add time
4. Enter time details:

   * Optionally, you can also:
     + Add a **description** for the time entry
     + Select a **project**
     + Add **tags** for easy categorization
     + Mark the time as **billable** or not

Once you’ve entered all the details, click **Add** to finalize the time entry.

### Add time from the Calendar page [#](#add-time-from-the-calendar-page)

2. Click the **Teammates** button and select the teammate whose calendar you want to view
3. Add time:
   * Click on any open time slot in the calendar to add a time entry

## Manage team members’ time entries [#](#manage-team-members-time-entries)

As a Workspace Admin or Team Manager, you have the ability to oversee and manage the time entries and expenses submitted by your team members. This includes ensuring the accuracy of tracked hours and expenses.

### Manage time entries and expenses: [#](#manage-time-entries-and-expenses)

* **Time tracking management** is available on **Standard** and higher plans, and can be performed by **Workspace Admins** and **Team Managers**
* **Expense management** is available on **Pro** and higher plans, and can also be handled by **Workspace admins** and **Team managers**.

You can review each team member’s time to ensure they are logging the correct hours, adjusting any inaccuracies, and verifying that the time aligns with project budgets and client agreements.

## Unsubmitted time entries [#](#unsubmitted-time-entries)

Sometimes, team members may forget to submit their time entries. As an Admin or Team manager, you can review unsubmitted time entries and send reminders.

#### To review tracked time and remind team members: [#](#to-review-tracked-time-and-remind-team-members)

1. Go to **Approvals** page and click the **Unsubmitted** tab to view users
2. Click **Remind to submit** to send reminder email

**To submit tracked time:**

1. Click the three dots for the unsubmitted time
2. Choose **Submit** to submit the timesheet for the user

If you go to the **Weekly report** page and filter by **Status**, you can find users who have no approved time.

## Withdraw and edit approved time [#](#withdraw-and-edit-approved-time)

If there is an error in an approved time entry, you as an Admin can withdraw approval and edit the time.

Steps to withdraw approval and edit time:

1. Navigate to **Approvals** and go to the **Archive** tab
2. Find the time period to edit
3. Withdraw approval:
   * Click on the approval request and select **Withdraw approval** in the top-right corner
   * Add a note explaining why the approval is being withdrawn and what changes are needed

Once approval is withdrawn, all time entries for that period will become editable again. You can then modify the time entries in the **Detailed Reports** section.

After withdrawing approval, a permanent copy of the approved time entries will be stored in the **Withdrawn** tab for auditing purposes.

Next steps:

* Get familiar with the **[Timesheet](https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/timesheet-view)** and **[Detailed reports](https://clockify.me/help/reports/detailed-report)** pages
* Make sure your workspace settings are configured to allow Team managers to edit time (if desired)
* Review the **Approvals** section regularly to manage unsubmitted or incorrect time entries
