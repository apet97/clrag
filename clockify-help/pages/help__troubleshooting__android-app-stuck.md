## Force close the app [#](#force-close-the-app)

## Check default browser settings [#](#check-default-browser-settings)

Clockify uses your default browser to load the login page, so if a non-standard or incompatible browser is set, it may cause issues.

1. Go to Settings -> Apps -> Default apps
2. Tap Browser app
3. Select Chrome or Firefox as your default browser

If you do not have those browsers installed, download them from the Play Store.
