# I can’t select a project when creating an invoice

2 min read

If you’re creating an invoice but can’t find or select the project you need, here’s how to fix it.

## The wrong client is selected in the invoice [#](#the-wrong-client-is-selected-in-the-invoice)

Only projects tied to the specific client you selected when creating an invoice will appear in the project dropdown.

Even if the project is correctly assigned to a client, it won’t show up unless it’s tied to the exact client currently selected on the invoice.

What to do:

1. On the New Invoice screen, check the Client dropdown at the top
2. Confirm that this is the same client assigned to the project you’re trying to select
3. If the client doesn’t match, the project won’t appear in the list
4. If needed, edit the project to assign it to the correct client:

* Go to the Projects page
* Click on the project to open it
* Navigate to the Settings tab and change the client

## The project is archived and filtered out of view [#](#the-project-is-archived-and-filtered-out-of-view)

Archived projects can be selected when creating an invoice, but they are hidden by default. The invoice project dropdown only shows active projects unless you manually change the filter.

How to make archived projects visible:

1. On the “Import time and expenses” Screen, click the Projects dropdown
2. In the top right corner of the dropdown, click the small arrow next to “Show”
3. Select Active and Archived to display all projects
4. Once selected, your archived project should now appear and be available for invoicing

## The project isn’t assigned to a client [#](#the-project-isnt-assigned-to-a-client)

Invoices are client-based, so only projects tied to the selected client will appear in the project dropdown.

How to assign a project to a client:

1. Go to the Projects page
2. Click on the project to open it
3. Navigate to the Settings tab
4. Assign the correct client
