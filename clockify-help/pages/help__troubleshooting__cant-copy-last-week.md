# I can’t copy last week in the Timesheet

2 min read

The Copy Last Week option in the Timesheet view lets you quickly duplicate projects and tasks with or without hours from the previous week. If the option is grayed out or not working, here’s what might be causing it.

## The approval period is not set to weekly  [#](#the-approval-period-is-not-set-to-weekly)

The Copy Last Week feature only works when your workspace uses a weekly approval period. If the approval range is set to semi-monthly or monthly, the button will be grayed out.

Here’s how to check the approval period:

1. Click on the three dots next to your workspace name and select “Workspace Settings”
2. Scroll down until you see the “Approvals” feature
3. Check the approval period

If you are a regular user in the workspace, ask your admin to review the approval period under Workspace Settings.

This behavior applies to timesheet templates as well. You can create and apply them only if the approval period has been set to “Weekly”.

## The timesheet for the previous week is blank [#](#the-timesheet-for-the-previous-week-is-blank)

If you didn’t track any time during the previous week, there’s nothing to copy.

* At least one time entry must be present in last week’s timesheet
* The button won’t appear if the previous week is empty
* You can check last week’s time by clicking on the back arrow on the calendar icon

## The current week already has time entries [#](#the-current-week-already-has-time-entries)

The Copy Last Week option only works if your current week is completely empty.

* If you’ve already added time even to one cell, the button will be grayed out
* Clear all time entries for the current week if you want to copy a previous one

If you see a message that some time entries couldn’t be copied, it’s likely because one or more projects or tasks have been archived or deleted since last week. You can check that on the Projects page by using the “Archived” filter.
