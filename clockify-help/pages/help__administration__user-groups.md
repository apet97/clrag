# Groups

3 min read

Groups make [managing people on projects](https://clockify.me/help/projects/managing-people-on-projects) easier. Instead of adding people to project one by one, you can create a group and assign it to a [project](https://clockify.me/help/projects#Manageprojects) in one click.

You can create, edit, and delete groups in the **Groups** tab of a **Team** page.

## Create group [#](#create-group)

To create new group:

1. Go to the **Team** page
2. Open the **Groups** tab
3. Enter the group’s name in the **Add new group** field
4. Click **Add**, or press **Enter** to create new group

## Assign user to group [#](#assign-user-to-group)

To assign people to a group:

1. Go to the **Team** page
2. Open the **Groups** tab
3. Click **+ Access** under **Access column** next to the group’s name
4. Add people to the selected group

or

1. Go to the **Team** page

4. Click **+ Group**

Enter user group name in the provided field, and you’ll automatically create new user group. Member will be automatically added to a newly created group.   
You can search for the workspace members in the search field by their group and name.

## Remove user from group [#](#remove-user-from-group)

Remove a user from a group the same way as you added them.

To remove user from a group:

1. Go to the **Team** page
2. Open the **Groups** tab
3. Select the group you’d like to remove the user from
4. Click on the dropdown in the **Access** section
5. Uncheck the user to remove them

## Assign groups to projects [#](#assign-groups-to-projects)

Groups make managing people on projects easy. When people change teams or leave the company often, you don’t have to go through each project and remove them – all you have to do is remove them from the group.

You can add users to groups on the **Team** page, and then [allocate the group](https://clockify.me/help/projects/managing-people-on-projects#adding-people-to-projects) to a project.

To assign a group to a project:

1. Go to a project
2. Click **Access** tab
3. Click **+ Add** members
4. Select the group

Once you assign a group, everyone that belongs to that group will immediately have access to the project.

You can [filter reports](https://clockify.me/help/reports/filtering-reports) by a group. For example, you can make a Developers group, and use the group as a filter to see only what your developers work on (and later, [group the report](https://clockify.me/help/reports/summary-report) by User to see the time breakdown for each developer). You can also simply group the Summary report by Group and see a breakdown for each group.
