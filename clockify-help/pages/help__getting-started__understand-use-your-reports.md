4 min read

This guide will walk regular users through how to view, interpret, and filter their time-tracking reports in Clockify. You will learn how to access various types of reports, filter by specific criteria like date, project, or client, and customize reports to fit your needs.

## Overview of reports [#](#overview-of-reports)

Clockify offers several types of reports to help you track time and expenses:

* **Summary report**This report groups your time entries by various criteria, such as project, client, user, tag, or date. It’s ideal for getting an overview of your time entries over a specific date range.
* **Detailed report**This report shows all the details of your time entries, without grouping or summarizing. It provides a line-by-line breakdown of each time entry.
* **Weekly report**Weekly report is great for weekly tracking, since it shows time entries grouped by user or project within a fixed week range.

## Navigate the reports [#](#navigate-the-reports)

To access and navigate the reports section:

1. Go to the **Reports** page in the sidebar If the **Reports** page is not visible, it might be restricted by your workspace admins.
2. Choose between the **Summary**, **Detailed**, or **Weekly** report, depending on your needs

## Filter your reports [#](#filter-your-reports)

Clockify allows you to filter your reports by several criteria to get the data you need. Here’s how to filter your reports:

1. Choose time period  
   At the top of the **Report** page, select the **Calendar** date range for the report. You can choose custom date ranges or predefined options like last week or this month.
2. Filter by Project, Client, or User  
   **Project**: Filter by active or archived projects  
   **Client**: Filter by active or archived clients  
   **User**: Filter by specific team members, or show all users (active/inactive)
3. Filter by entry status, tag, or taskYou can filter time entries by **status** (approved, pending, etc.), **description**, **tag**, or **task** to get a more granular view of the time tracked.

## Reports data [#](#reports-data)

Once you have applied the relevant filters, the report will display the following key data points:

1. **Total time worked**This is the total amount of time tracked during the selected period. It includes both billable and non-billable hours.
2. **Billable hours**Billable hours are the time entries that are considered chargeable to a client or project. These will be separated from non-billable hours in the report.
3. **Project summaries**If you group your report by project, you will see a breakdown of total time tracked for each project. This is useful for understanding how much time was spent on each project.
4. **Total amount**For billable hours, the report will also display the total monetary value based on the rate set for each project or client.

## Customize and export reports [#](#customize-and-export-reports)

Clockify offers a variety of options for customizing and exporting your reports:

1. Customize the report for export  
   You can adjust the filters and groupings to create a report tailored to your needs, whether you need a summary, detailed breakdown, or weekly overview.
2. Export report in one of the formats (PDF, Excel or CSV)
3. Save report

For more precise reporting, you can enable or disable rounding for the time entries in the report if you want time tracked in minutes to be rounded up or down to the nearest increment.
