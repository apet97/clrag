# Unable to change the Week Start setting

2 min read

If you’re trying to adjust the start of the week in Clockify but not seeing the change take effect, the behavior may depend on where the setting is being updated and your role in the workspace.

## Changing the week start in Workspace Settings only applies to new users [#](#changing-the-week-start-in-workspace-settings-only-applies-to-new-users)

You can set the default week start day from the Workspace Settings (by clicking the three dots next to your workspace name), but this setting only affects new team members who join the workspace after the change is made.

Your own week view won’t update by changing the workspace setting.

## How to change your own week start setting [#](#how-to-change-your-own-week-start-setting)

If you want to change the week start for your own view:

1. Navigate to the Team page
2. Find your name on the list and click on the three dots next to it
3. Select Edit Profile
4. Choose your preferred Week start day
5. Click “Save”

## You don’t have access to the Team page [#](#you-dont-have-access-to-the-team-page)

If you’re a regular user and don’t have access to the Team page, an admin will need to update this setting on your behalf.

Admins can:

1. Navigate to the Team page
2. Click on the three dots next to the user’s name
3. Select Edit Profile
4. Update the Week start setting
5. Save changes
