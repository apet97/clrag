# I can’t edit team member’s time

2 min read

If you are unable to edit someone’s time entry, it’s usually due to workspace settings or approved time entries.

## Workspace role [#](#workspace-role)

Make sure that you have the correct role assigned in the workspace. As per the current design:

* Admins can edit time entries for everyone
* Team Managers can only edit the time for users they manage if enabled in the Workspace Settings
* Project Managers can’t edit time for others

You can check your role via the Team page. If you do not have access to the Team page, contact your admin.

## The Force Timer or Lock Timesheets features are enabled [#](#the-force-timer-or-lock-timesheets-features-are-enabled)

If you’ve enabled the Force Timer or Lock Timesheets feature, as an admin, you can still edit time for other team members via the Detailed Report. However, if the Force Timer is enabled, you won’t be able to make changes via the Timesheet.

Here’s how to do it on the Detailed Report:

1. Navigate to the Detailed report
2. Select a date range from the calendar
3. Select a team member from the “Team” filter and apply it
4. Find the entry you’d like to edit and make changes in the designated fields

## Time entry has been approved [#](#time-entry-has-been-approved)

Approved time entries are locked and can’t be edited by anyone, including admins.

* Approved time entries will have a green check mark in the Detailed report and Timesheet
* To edit them, the timesheet will need to be withdrawn

To withdraw a timesheet:

1. Navigate to the Approvals tab from the sidebar
2. Find the relevant timesheet under the Archive tab
3. Click to open it and select “Withdraw” in the upper right corner
4. Go back to the Detailed report and make the changes
