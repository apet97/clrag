# Set up alerts & reminders for your Workspace members

4 min read

Learn how to set up alerts and reminders to help track project progress and ensure time logging accuracy.

Only Admins can create project alerts. Project managers will receive alerts if they are set to receive notifications for their projects. Team managers will receive alerts for their team’s progress and can be notified if team members exceed or miss their time tracking targets.

## Set up project alerts [#](#set-up-project-alerts)

**Project alerts** notify you when a project reaches a certain percentage of its estimated time or expenses. You can set these alerts to monitor project progress and prevent overages.

To set up project alerts:

1. Open the **Workspace Settings** menu
2. Switch to the **Alerts** tab
3. Choose if you want alerts for **Projects** or **Tasks**, and specify the percentage of the estimated time at which the alert should trigger
4. Select who should receive the alerts:
   * **All Admins**
   * **All Project managers** (for their projects)
   * **Project Members** (for project alerts)
   * **Task Assignees** (for task alerts)

Click **Add** to save the alert.

### Additional note [#](#additional-note)

* Alerts are sent when the set percentage is reached
* If someone edits their time and the percentage drops below the threshold, the alert will trigger again when it reaches the set percentage
* Alerts apply to all projects with estimates and cannot be set for individual projects
* If you exclude **non-billable** time from project estimates, it won’t count toward the time alert
* Alerts are generated at the **30-minute mark** of each hour
* Only users with **verified emails** will receive alerts

## Remove alerts [#](#remove-alerts)

To delete an alert:

1. Click the **X** next to it
2. Select **Delete**

## Set up time tracking targets & reminders [#](#set-up-time-tracking-targets-reminders)

You can set time tracking targets for your team (daily, weekly, or monthly) and automatically remind them to log their hours via email if they miss their targets or log too many hours.

Based on their configuration, reminders can be divided in three different ways:

* **Daily reminder**: Sent the next day if targets aren’t met
* **Weekly reminder**: Sent on the first day of the next week
* **Monthly reminder**: Sent on the first day of the next month

To set up Timesheet reminders:

1. Go to **Team > Reminders** tab
2. Set a **target number of hours** for your team members (daily, weekly, or monthly)
3. Choose when reminders should be sent based on whether the team member logs **more** or **less** than the target hours
4. Click **Add** to save the reminder

**Important notes**:

* Team members will not receive reminders if they are on **time off** or a **holiday**
* You can set multiple reminders for each user (e.g. 7 hours per day, 40 hours per week, 150 hours per month)

## Email notifications for Managers & Admins [#](#email-notifications-for-managers-admins)

Managers and admins can receive daily, weekly, or monthly emails about team members who missed their time targets or logged more than the target.

How to receive email notifications:

1. When creating a reminder, click on the **Them** option
2. Select who should receive the email notifications:
   * **Admins**: All admins will receive emails
   * **Team managers**: Only for their own team members

Admins and managers will receive email summaries according to their **personal Day Start** and **Timezone** settings. The email will list everyone who has either **missed** or **exceeded** their target hours.

## Edit or remove reminders [#](#edit-or-remove-reminders)

You can easily update existing reminders if you need to change the target hours or adjust the recipients.

To edit reminders:

1. Go to the **Reminders** tab
2. Click on the **highlighted section** (e.g. users, hours, etc.) to make adjustments

To remove a reminder:

Click the **X** next to the reminder you want to delete.
