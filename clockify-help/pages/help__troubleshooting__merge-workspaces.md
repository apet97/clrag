# Can I merge workspaces?

2 min read

Each workspace is treated as a separate entity with its own users, projects, and data. This means there’s no built-in option to directly combine two or more workspaces into one.

However, if you’d like to move data from one workspace to another, you can do so manually by exporting and importing data using CSV files.

## How to move data between workspaces [#](#how-to-move-data-between-workspaces)

In the workspace you want to move data from, go to the Detailed report and export the data to a CSV file



* This file includes time entries, projects, tasks, clients, and more
* Before exporting, make sure to select the correct date range from the calendar

1. Navigate to the Detailed report
2. Select a date range from the calendar
3. Apply filters (optional)
4. Export to CSV

* If you are on a paid plan, you can select a custom date range that spans multiple years
* If you’re on a free plan, you’ll need to export data year by year

In the workspace you want to move data to, use the CSV import feature to upload the file

 To import your CSV file:

1. Click on the three dots next to your workspace name
2. Select “Workspace settings”
3. Go to the “Import” tab
4. Click “Upload CSV file” and select your exported file from the file browser

Importing data is only available on paid plans. Only time entry data and related metadata (projects, clients, etc.) will be imported. Workspace settings, roles, access, etc., will not carry over.
