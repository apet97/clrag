# Time and amounts mismatch in reports

3 min read

If you’re noticing a mismatch in your reports, here are a few common reasons why that happens:

## Compact mode is enabled [#](#compact-mode-is-enabled)

* In Compact Mode, each time entry is automatically rounded to the nearest full minute for display purposes only
* This does not affect the actual tracked time; the system always stores time in the full format

* To view the exact time format:

1. Navigate to the workspace settings by clicking on the three dots next to your workspace name
2. Under the “Duration Format” drop-down, select “Full”

Once you switch to the full format, your reports will show you the most accurate data without rounding.

## Rate hierarchy affects calculations [#](#rate-hierarchy-affects-calculations)

Billing amounts may differ depending on how rates are applied. In Clockify, a more specific rate overrides a less specific one in this order:

**Project’s member rate > Task rate > Project rate > Member rate > Workspace rate**

* How to check which rates are applied

To identify where a rate is coming from, you can check each level in the rate hierarchy:

**Project Member Rate**



* Go to the Projects page and open the relevant project
* Navigate to the Team tab inside the project
* Check the rate column for each team member

**Task Rate**



* While still inside the project, navigate to the Tasks tab
* Check the rate column for each task

**Project Rate**



* Navigate to the Settings tab inside a project
* Scroll a bit down and check the rate

**Team Member Rate**



* Navigate to the Team tab located on the sidebar
* Check the rate for each team member under the rate column

**Workspace Rate**



* Click on the three dots next to the workspace name
* Click on the ‘Workspace Settings’ option
* Scroll down and check the workspace rate

You can edit the rates by selecting the ‘Change’ button located next to each hourly rate. If you are on a paid plan, you’ll have an option to apply the rate retroactively by selecting the ‘Apply to all future and past time entries’ option.

## Discrepancy in Excel report [#](#discrepancy-in-excel-report)

If you’re seeing small differences in totals when exporting reports to Excel, this is due to how decimals are handled:

* The web app and PDF exports calculate the amounts using 4 decimal places, which ensures precise totals, especially when time is multiplied by hourly rates.
* When exporting to Excel, the data is sent with only 2 decimal places for display and compatibility reasons
* If you use Excel’s SUM formula, the totals may be slightly off due to rounding at the line-item level

**Example:**

A time entry amount of $33.3368 might appear as $33.34 in Excel. When summed across multiple entries, those small differences can add up.

**For the most accurate values:**

* Rely on the web report or PDF export, which reflects the true calculation using full decimal precision.
* Use Excel exports primarily for raw data or basic overviews
