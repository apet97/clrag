# PIN

2 min read

You can require your employees to enter a personal 4-digit PIN to clock in via a [kiosk](https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/track-time-on-kiosk).

PIN is a [paid feature](https://clockify.me/help/administration/subscription-plans), that you can enable by upgrading your account to any paid plan.

## Enabling PIN [#](#enabling-pin)

When you create or edit a kiosk, you should enable the **Requires PIN** checkbox. If you don’t, everyone can select any employee’s profile and clock in for them.

**Universal PIN**

Each kiosk has a **Universal PIN** that allows you to clock in and out for any employee (except **owner/admin**)  
e.g. Give this PIN to a shift manager so that can clock in for a team if needed.

## Entering PIN [#](#entering-pin)

Each person automatically gets their own **personal** **PIN code**.

To clock in, an employee simply selects their profile on the kiosk and enters their personal PIN.

If you know kiosk’s **Universal PIN**, you can enter it instead of a personal PIN to clock in for any employee.

A **Universal PIN** cannot be used to sign in with owner/admin role. They must always use their personal PIN code.
