# I can’t see my team members’ time

3 min read

If you can’t see your team member’s tracked time in reports, try the following steps:

## Verify the date range [#](#verify-the-date-range)

By default, the date range on all reports is set to “This week”, so you might be missing time tracked on other dates. Here’s how to check that:

1. Select the calendar icon located in the upper right corner
2. Choose a date range from the presets on the side, like “Last week”, “This month,” or select a custom date range by clicking on the start and ending dates
3. Check if the time entries now appear

This helps ensure that you’re not filtering out relevant data by accident.

## Verify that the team member is tracking time in your workspace [#](#verify-that-the-team-member-is-tracking-time-in-your-workspace)

Team members can belong to multiple workspaces, including their own personal one. If you’re not seeing their time in reports, it’s possible they’re tracking time in a different workspace.

To fix this, ask your team member to confirm they are tracking time in your shared workspace, not their personal one. Here’s how they can check that:

1. Click on the workspace switcher located in the upper left corner
2. Check how many workspaces you have in the dropdown menu
3. Make sure that you’re logged into the shared workspace

Each workspace is treated separately, so if a team member is tracking time in their personal workspace, you won’t be able to see that data in your shared workspace.

## Confirm that they are invited to your workspace [#](#confirm-that-they-are-invited-to-your-workspace)

Make sure that the team member is actually invited to the workspace and is an active member of it.

1. Navigate to the team page
2. Find the user in question
3. Make sure that they are active
4. If they have the “Not joined yet” tag next to their name, it means that they haven’t accepted the invitation, in which case, you can resend it by clicking on the three dots next to their name

## Review permissions [#](#review-permissions)

If you are still unable to see the time entries, make sure that you have the right permissions to do so.

Access to time entries depends on your role in the workspace:

* Admins can see all time entries
* Project Managers can see time entries only for users tracking time on their projects
  + Ask an admin to confirm the team member is assigned to your projects
* Team Managers can only see users within their assigned team
  + Ask an admin to verify that the person you’re trying to view is a part of your team
