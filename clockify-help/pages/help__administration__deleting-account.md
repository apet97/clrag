# Delete account

2 min read

This article will guide you through the process of deleting your account. Follow the steps carefully to make sure your account is removed, and learn what happens with your workspace data following deletion.

Your Clockify account can be deleted within the [CAKE.com organization](https://cake.com/help/administration/deactivate-and-delete-user-account/).

To delete your Clockify account:

1. Navigate to the **Profile settings** in your Clockify app
2. Choose **Manage CAKE.com Account** option

You’ll be redirected to your [CAKE.com Account](https://cake.com/help/introduction-to-cake-com/what-is-cake-com-productivity-suite/#cake-com-account) management page, where you can complete the action.

## As workspace owner [#](#as-workspace-owner)

If you’re the owner of the workspace and there are other users in your workspace, you won’t be able to delete your account until you either:

* [Transfer your owner role](https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/workspaces#transfer-workspace-ownership) to someone else
* Remove all active team members from the workspace(s) where you are the owner

Once you’re not an owner of any workspace anymore, or once you’re the only active member in workspace(s) where you are the owner, you can delete your account.

## What happens with data [#](#what-happens-with-data)

Clockify stores your data **indefinitely**, until you delete your account, or delete your data.

Once you confirm you want to delete your account:

* Your account will be deleted immediately
* All the workspaces (and data in them) where you are the owner will be deleted forever
* Time entries you’ve made in someone else’s workspace won’t be deleted. They will be preserved under your name until the owner of that workspace deletes the workspace
* Once you delete the account, there’s no undo. If you’d like a backup of all your time entries, you can export them in the [Detailed report](https://clockify.me/help/reports/detailed-report)
* You won’t receive any more emails from us
* Your subscription will end
