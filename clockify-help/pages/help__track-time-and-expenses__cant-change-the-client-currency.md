# Can’t change the client currency

2 min read

If you’re trying to change the currency for a client but don’t see any options in the dropdown, it’s likely because no additional currencies have been added yet.

1. Navigate to the Clients page from the sidebar
2. Click on the pen icon next to the Client you want to edit
3. In the pop-up window, scroll down to the button and click on the Currency dropdown

If the dropdown is empty, it means no other currencies have been created yet.

## How to add currencies to the workspace [#](#how-to-add-currencies-to-the-workspace)

To assign different currencies to clients, you’ll need to first create those currencies in your Workspace Settings. Only then will they appear as options when editing a client.

To add new currencies to your workspace:

1. Click on the three dots next to the Workspace name at the top of the page
2. Select “Workspace settings”
3. Scroll a bit down and click on “Edit” under the Currencies section
4. Select “Add currency”
5. Enter the currency abbreviation (e.g., EUR, GBP, CAD) and save

After that, go back to the Clients page and edit the client again. The new currency options will now be available in the dropdown.

Once the client’s currency is updated, all projects assigned to that client will automatically apply the selected currency for budgeting and invoicing.
