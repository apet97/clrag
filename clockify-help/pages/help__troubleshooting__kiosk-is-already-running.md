# Kiosk is already running

2 min read

This message usually means the system thinks there is an active session somewhere. Here’s how to fix it.

## Free plan allows only one active kiosk [#](#free-plan-allows-only-one-active-kiosk)

If you are on the free plan, you can only have one kiosk active at a time. Trying to launch a second one will trigger this message.

What to do:

* Check if you already have an active kiosk running on another device or a browser tab
* If needed, close that kiosk before launching a new one

Multiple kiosks are available only on our paid plans.

## Kiosk is already running  [#](#kiosk-is-already-running)

 Make sure the kiosk isn’t already open and active on another device. Ask your team or check the device it was last used on.

## Deactivate and reactivate the kiosk [#](#deactivate-and-reactivate-the-kiosk)

If no one else is using the kiosk, try resetting it:

1. Go to the Kiosks page from the sidebar
2. Click on the three dots next to the kiosk and select Deactivate
3. Once inactive, click on the three dots again and select Activate
4. Copy the link and try launching it again

## Clear browser memory or use incognito mode [#](#clear-browser-memory-or-use-incognito-mode)

Your browser may be holding onto an old session.

* Try launching the kiosk in incognito/private mode
* Or clear the cache and cookies from the browser
