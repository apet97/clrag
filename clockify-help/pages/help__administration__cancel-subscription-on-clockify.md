6. (Optional) Share feedback to help us improve
7. Confirm your decision

## After you cancel [#](#after-you-cancel)

* You won’t be charged again after your current billing period ends
* Paid features will be available until the end of your current billing cycle
* You’ll be automatically switched to the [Free plan](https://clockify.me/help/administration/subscription-plans#free) after the paid period ends
* All your previous invoices are still available for download
* All your data stays safe – Clockify doesn’t delete anything unless you choose to remove your workspace or [CAKE.com account](https://cake.com/help/introduction-to-cake-com/what-is-cake-com-productivity-suite/#cake-com-account)

When you cancel your subscription, you’ll be asked to complete a brief survey. We’d appreciate your honest feedback to help us improve Clockify for the future.

Subscription changes don’t affect your content or data. However, after cancellation, changes to the **Customer info** tab will no longer be possible.

If you’re canceling a Bundle plan, all workspaces in your organization will be downgraded to the Free plan. Learn more about how Bundle subscriptions work in [this](https://cake.com/help/billing/cake-com-bundle-subscription/) article.

Before you cancel, you can explore switching to a different [subscription plan](https://clockify.me/help/administration/subscription-plans) that better suits your needs.

If payment for a past-due subscription is canceled, your subscription will end immediately.
