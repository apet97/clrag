# Track your time

5 min read

With Clockify, you can easily track the time you spend on various activities, whether you’re using the **Web app**, **Browser extension**, **Desktop app**, or **Mobile app**. This guide covers the basics of time tracking, including how to start and stop timers, manage time entries, and use additional features that make tracking easier.

## Set up time tracking [#](#set-up-time-tracking)

Before you can start tracking time, you need to ensure that the **Time Tracker** is activated and accessible in your workspace.

#### To access Time Tracker page: [#](#to-access-time-tracker-page)

1. **Log in to your account** and navigate to your workspace
2. From the sidebar, click on the **Time Tracker** to access the page

Once you’re on the **Time Tracker** page, you’re ready to start tracking your time.

### Choose your time tracking platform [#](#choose-your-time-tracking-platform)

You can track time using one of the following platforms:

* [**Web app**](https://app.clockify.me/en/login)
* **Browser extension** ([Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/clockify-time-tracker/pmjeegjhjdlccodhacdgbgfagbpmccpe?pli=1)/[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clockify-time-tracker/))
* **Desktop app** ([Mac](https://clockify.me/mac-time-tracking), [Windows](https://clockify.me/help/apps/windows-desktop-app), [Linux](https://clockify.me/help/apps/linux-desktop-app))
* **Mobile app** ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clockify-time-tracker/id1304431926)/[Android](https://clockify.me/help/apps/android-app))

All tracked data syncs online, so you can access your time entries from any device.

## Track time with timer [#](#track-time-with-timer)

### Start timer [#](#start-timer)

To begin tracking your time, follow these steps:

1. On the **Time Tracker** page, click the **clock icon** in the upper-right corner to enter **Timer mode**
2. Enter activity details (Optional):
   * **What are you working on?**: Type a description of your activity
   * **Project/Task**: Select or create a project/task you’re working on
   * **Billability**: Choose if the time is billable
   * **Tags**: Add any relevant tags to categorize the activity  
     **Note: Please check with your manager if there is some sort of a predefined workflow that you should follow when it comes to entering time entry details.**

Click **START** to start tracking time.

### Stop timer [#](#stop-timer)

When you finish your task:

1. Go back to the **Time tracker** page
2. Click the **STOP** button to stop the timer

The timer will continue running until you manually stop it. If you leave the page or close the browser, the timer will keep running unless you’re using the browser extension (which can stop it automatically).

When the timer is running, a Clockify tab icon appears in your browser tab. This helps you know if the timer is still active, preventing accidental omissions.

## Manage time entries [#](#manage-time-entries)

### Continue a previous entry [#](#continue-a-previous-entry)

If you need to continue tracking time for a previous task:

1. Go to your **Timesheet** and find the time entry you want to continue
2. Click the **play icon** next to the entry

The timer will restart with all the details you previously entered automatically copied.

You can edit the following details for any time entry:

* **Description**: Modify what you were working on
* **Project/Task**: Update associated project or task
* **Tags**: Add or remove tags to categorize the entry
* **Billability**: Adjust if the time should be marked as billable
* **Start/End time**: Edit the start and end times
* **Duration**: Update the total time recorded
* **Custom fields**: Adjust any custom field values, if applicable

To edit a time entry:

1. Go to your **Timesheet**
2. Find the entry you want to change
3. Click the **edit** icon next to the entry to make your changes

In order to see the Timesheet page, the page needs to be enabled in the Workspace settings by the Workspace Owner/Admin.

You can edit time entries in the same way from the **Time tracker** page, as well.

To do that:

1. Go to the **Time tracker** page
2. Find the entry you tracked that you would like to edit
3. Make the changes by directly editing entry’s data
4. Open the three-dots menu to see more ways in which you can modify your entry

### Bulk edit, split, or duplicate entries [#](#bulk-edit-split-or-duplicate-entries)

You can manage multiple time entries at once:

* **Bulk edit**: Select multiple entries and apply changes (e.g. update project/task, billability)
* **Split entry**: Break a long time entry into multiple smaller ones.
* **Duplicate entry**: Create a copy of an existing time entry to reuse for similar tasks

### Delete or undo time entries [#](#delete-or-undo-time-entries)

If you make a mistake, you can delete or undo actions:

* **Delete**: Click the **trash can icon** next to a time entry to remove it
* **Undo**: Use the **undo** button to restore a deleted or discarded entry

### Mark time as favorite [#](#mark-time-as-favorite)

You can mark frequently used time entries as favorites for easy access:

1. Click on the three-dots button of that entry
2. Choose **Add as favorite** option from the dropdown
3. You can **continue** a timer from any favorite entry by clicking the **play icon**

## FAQ [#](#faq)

### How do I track time if I forget to start the timer? [#](#how-do-i-track-time-if-i-forget-to-start-the-timer)

If you forget to start the timer, you can manually adjust the start time by clicking on the entry you’ve already created and entering the correct start time. You can also add and review previously tracked time on the [Timesheet](https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/timesheet-view) page.

### Can I track time on multiple projects at the same time? [#](#can-i-track-time-on-multiple-projects-at-the-same-time)

You can only have one running timer per workspace at a time. However, if you have multiple workspaces, you can track time on different projects simultaneously, one timer per workspace.

### What happens if I forget to stop the timer? [#](#what-happens-if-i-forget-to-stop-the-timer)

If the timer runs for an extended period of time, Clockify can send you an email reminder. You can turn this notification on or off in your [Profile settings](https://clockify.me/help/administration/profile-settings).

### Can I change the project or task while the timer is running? [#](#can-i-change-the-project-or-task-while-the-timer-is-running)

Yes, you can update the project, task, description, and other details while the timer is running by editing the fields directly on the **Time tracker** page.

### How can I add time manually? [#](#how-can-i-add-time-manually)

If you need to add time manually (without using the timer), switch to [Manual mode](https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/adding-time-manually). In this mode, you can input the time details, including the start and end time, description, project/task, and other relevant information.

### How do I continue a previously tracked time entry? [#](#how-do-i-continue-a-previously-tracked-time-entry)

In your **Time tracker**, locate the time entry you want to continue and click the **play icon**. The timer will resume with the same description, project, and tags.
