1 min read

These instructions explain how to create or edit an expense using the Clockify API, which requires a specific formatting technique. Expenses are handled differently compared to other API requests in Clockify.

## Steps to create/edit an expense via API [#](#steps-to-create-edit-an-expense-via-api)

* **Log in to Postman**: Ensure you are logged into your Postman account
* **Create a POST (create expense) or PUT (edit expense) request**:
  + Set the request path to   
    [`/v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}/expenses`](https://docs.clockify.me/#tag/Expense/operation/createExpense)
* **Set headers**:
  + Add `X-Api-Key` for authentication
  + Set `Content-Type` to `multipart/form-data`
* **Body format**:
  + Choose `form-data` instead of `raw` for the body type
  + Enter the following keys and corresponding values (without quotes):
    - **KEY**: `user_id`, `date, project_id`, `category_id`, `notes`, `amount`, `billable`
    - **VALUE**: Enter the data values directly (no quotations around the values)
* **Send the request**: After sending, check the status of the request
  + If successful, you should see a `201 Created` response
  + The response will be displayed in **JSON** format
