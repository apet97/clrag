# Forecast project completion

2 min read

Forecasting helps you visualize your project’s progress based on tracked time. See how you’ve performed on recurring projects for a set time period and make predictions based on scheduled assignments and add estimates or budget to see if the project will go over or under them.

Forecasting is a paid feature, available to admins only. You can enable it by [upgrading](https://clockify.me/pricing) your workspace to Pro or Enterprise plan.

User interface displayed in this video may not correspond to the latest version of the app.

## Create chart [#](#create-chart)

1. Go to the **Projects** page from the sidebar
2. Choose **Forecast** tab
3. Pick a date or a time period in the future

Every point in the X axis will show the value of the specific time period you picked (day, week, month).

**Day**: Value in the x axis is in days and every point in the curve shows value by day.   
**Week**: Value in the x axis shows the whole week for every point.  
**Month**: Value in the x axis shows the whole month for every point.
