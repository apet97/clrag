# Time audit

2 min read

Time audit helps you and your team find and fix faulty time entries.

Audits can be conducted both by admins and regular users:

* Admin can find all the faulty entries in the entire workspace with one click and fix them
* Team members can find their incomplete entries with one click and fix them

A time audit is a paid feature, which you can enable by [upgrading](https://clockify.me/pricing) your workspace to any of the paid plans.

To record and analyze changes made to time entries (e.g. who changed start time, deleted entry, etc.), you can use the [Audit log](https://clockify.me/help/administration/audit-log) feature.

## When to use time audit [#](#when-to-use-time-audit)

* When you’re in the middle of something, you just want to start a timer and add a project/categorize the entry later.
* When you need to clean up timesheets before invoicing clients and you need to find entries that your team forgot to categorize.
* Find time entries you’ve made by accident (shorter than 1 minute or longer than 8 hours) so you can delete them.

## How to use time audit [#](#how-to-use-time-audit)

To use time audit:

1. Go to **Detailed report**
2. Click **Time Audit** drop-down
3. Select what kind of entries you want to find (without a project/task, suspicious duration)
4. Directly edit time entries (add project/task, delete, fix duration)

You can also use [filters](https://clockify.me/help/reports/filtering-reports) on top of the audit.

When you select **Suspicious duration**, you can define the duration that makes an entry suspicious. To clear suspicious duration filter, click **Clear all**.
