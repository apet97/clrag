# Manage non-working days

3 min read

Define and manage holidays and policies on the **Time off** page.

Time off is a paid feature, which you can enable by [upgrading](https://clockify.me/pricing) your workspace to Standard, Pro, or Enterprise plan.

To manage your non-working days:

1. Navigate to the **Time off** page
2. Click on the **Settings** icon
3. Define working days in the **Workspace settings** (Saturdays and Sundays are marked as non-working days, by default).

## Manage holidays [#](#manage-holidays)

Manage holidays by creating multiple ones, assigning different people to different holidays (e.g. if some people don’t get time off for a specific holiday), specifying if you’d like the holiday to occur annually and defining a holiday color. Choose one, or make a custom holiday color.

When people request time off, holidays and weekends won’t count.

*For example, if someone requests Jan 1 – Jan 7 for time off – and Jan 1 is holiday, Jan 2 is Saturday, and Jan 3 is Sunday – their total request will be 4 days for time off.*

Created holidays are displayed in descending chronological order.   
Annual holidays without a specific year are sorted by date, either for this year or the next, depending on today’s date.

To edit or delete holidays:

1. Go to the **Time off** page
2. Click on the **Settings** button at the top right corner of the page
3. Choose **Manage** **holidays**
4. Click on **three dots** > **Edit** next to the holiday in the **Holidays** screen

You can edit the holiday name, people assigned to it, period of time, its annual occurrence and color.

Deleting or changing working days doesn’t impact existing time off requests.

## Manage policies [#](#manage-policies)

Holiday policies can be managed in the same way as holidays.

You can:

* Create multiple policies
* Assign different people to different policies (e.g. if certain policy doesn’t apply to certain people)
* Check if the policy requires approval and needs to be approved by admin or manager, or some other specific member

When managing holiday and time off policies, please note that you can enable automatic creation of time off and holiday entries. Approved time off requests and holidays can be tracked for the project you choose with the billability pulled from that project or task.
