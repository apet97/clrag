# Manage and configure add-ons

3 min read

Once you’ve successfully installed an add-on, take some time to explore the settings and features available in the **Add-ons** tab within the [Workspace settings](https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/workspaces#workspace-settings).  
Note that these settings are typically optional and defined by the developer who created them.

## Add-on menu in Clockify [#](#add-on-menu-in-clockify)

Installed add-ons are displayed at the top bar on the right and ordered based on whether they have some additional functionalities (settings) or not.

Paid add-ons will additionally have a tag indicating in which payment status they are currently in:

* **Overdue** (payment is overdue)

If payment is **Overdue**, a warning of the screen is displayed for user before they start using the add-on.

You can continue using an add-on with the Overdue status until the grace period (instalment date + 14 days) ends

* **Subscription ended** (payment failed)

After the 14 days of grace period are over, the add-on gets a new tag indicating that the subscription is over and that the add-on doesn’t work anymore.

The three-dots menu contains the following option: **Reinstall** (leads to **Install add-on modal**), **View on Marketplace** and **Remove**.

* **Unistalled** (add-on has been uninstalled)

Paid add-ons with **Payment failed** and **Uninstalled** status are never displayed in the main add-on dropdown.

You may see a **[Private](https://clockify.me/help/apps/start-using-add-ons#install-private-add-ons)** label next to some add-ons in your **My add-ons** list in the add-ons menu. These are not listed on the public Marketplace and are typically used for internal testing before a possible public release.  
For more details, please contact your organization owner or internal development team.

### Settings (if defined) [#](#settings-if-defined)

Some add-ons may have specific settings that you can access and modify in the **Settings**.

### Webhooks [#](#webhooks)

Explore the webhooks sent from Clockify to the particular add-on. Each webhook contains essential details such as the webhook name, the triggering event, and the URL where the webhook sends information.

### View on Marketplace [#](#view-on-marketplace)

By selecting this option, you’ll be directed to the Marketplace page where the add-on is published.

#### Enable/disable [#](#enable-disable)

Installed add-ons are automatically enabled. You can disable an add-on if needed.

#### Browse Marketplace [#](#browse-marketplace)

To search other available add-ons, click the **Browse marketplace** button in the **Add-ons** tab. This will open the CAKE.com Marketplace homepage in a new window.

## Uninstall add-on from Clockify [#](#uninstall-add-on-from-clockify)

As an admin, you have the authority to uninstall add-ons from your workspace.

To do so, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to installed add-on and open its menu  
2. Choose **Uninstall**  
3. **Uninstall add-on** screen appears

4. Type and click **Uninstall** to confirm the action

As a result:

1. Add-on is disabled and removed from the workspace list in the dropdown
2. Add-on is disabled and removed from the **Add-ons** tab
3. Depending on the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, stored data might be lost

Paid add-on can be reinstalled without the additional payment.

## Cancel your subscription to Clockify add-on [#](#cancel-your-subscription-to-clockify-add-on)

To cancel your subscription, simply follow the instructions on how to [uninstall](https://clockify.me/help/apps/manage-and-configure-add-ons#uninstall-add-on-from-clockify) the add-on from your Clockify workspace.

## Plan changed or not matching [#](#plan-changed-or-not-matching)

If the add-on is unresponsive or the plan doesn’t match the add-on’s minimal plan in Clockify, you’ll receive an appropriate response in the app.

## Unresponsive [#](#unresponsive)

In case the add-on is unresponsive from the Clockify side, a screen will appear indicating that the app is currently unavailable.
