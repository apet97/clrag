# Workspace in Clockify

3 min read

A workspace is a collection of people and projects in Clockify. When you first register at Clockify, you’ll automatically get a Clockify workspace and your [CAKE.com Account](https://cake.com/help/introduction-to-cake-com/what-is-cake-com-productivity-suite/#cake-com-account) with an organization in it.   
You can also join a Clockify workspace in an existing [CAKE.com organization](https://cake.com/help/introduction-to-cake-com/glossary-of-terms/#o). A workspace contains all the time entries, projects, people, and settings.

With a single CAKE.com Account, you can create or join multiple Clockify workspaces. These workspaces are separate entities, each with their own unique set of users, projects, and time entries.

Multiple workspaces are useful when you want to have a separate account for each sub-company or a department. This way, things won’t mix up and you can have different [access levels](https://clockify.me/help/administration/user-roles-and-permissions/who-can-do-what).

*For example, if you have two companies or departments, you can create two workspaces, and invite different people to each one. Then, you can switch between them as needed.  
Or, you can be a team member in one workspace and track time for the company you work for, plus have a personal workspace where you’ll keep track of personal stuff and be admin.*

Everything in Clockify is tied to a specific workspace, so time entries you made in one workspace aren’t visible in another.

## Workspace settings [#](#workspace-settings)

Only workspace Owners and Admins can see and edit Workspace settings.
