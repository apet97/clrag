# Managers

3 min read

In Clockify, there are two types of managers: **Project** managers and **Team** managers.

Please note that CAKE.com permissions also apply, as CAKE.com operates as the central organization. For more details on CAKE.com permissions and how they affect individual products, please refer to [this article](https://cake.com/help/administration/roles-and-permissions/).

## Project manager [#](#project-manager)

**Project managers** can see all tracked time on their projects and can edit various aspects of their projects, such as:

* Set estimates
* Add tasks
* Manage project access
* Schedule their own projects and assignments
* Approve submitted timesheets for members assigned to their projects (if enabled)
* Launch kiosk (if enabled)

## Team manager [#](#team-manager)

**Team managers** have similar permissions but focus on overseeing their team members and groups. They can:

* See all tracked time for their team members
* Edit time for their team members (if enabled)
* Approve submitted timesheets for their team members (if enabled)
* Approve time off for their team members
* Launch kiosk (if enabled)

Team manager role is an additional feature available through upgrading your workspace to a Standard, Pro, or Enterprise plan.

Customizing visibility of certain app features, like hiding pages, also applies to managers. Managers have access to Reports, and project managers additionally have access to the Projects page.

## Assign manager [#](#assign-manager)

Admin/Owner can assign manager rights to a workspace member from a **Team** or **Projects** page in the following way:

1. Navigate to the **Team** or **Projects** page
2. Choose user or project
3. Configure role options
4. Choose the role and save the changes you’ve made
