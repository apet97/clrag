# How to import time off balance for multiple users via API

1 min read

To import time-off balances for multiple users, you can use the API to update the balance for each user.

## Steps [#](#steps)

1. **Create a `PATCH` request** to update user balances:  
   Endpoint: `PATCH`   
   [`/v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}/time-off/balance/policy/{policyId}/`](https://docs.clockify.me/#tag/Balance/operation/updateBalance)
2. **Prepare your CSV file**:  
   Extract user IDs from Clockify and prepare a CSV file with user IDs and corresponding balance data
3. **Run collection in Postman**:  
   Upload your CSV and execute the request

The users’ time-off balances will be updated successfully, and you will receive a `204 No Content` response.
