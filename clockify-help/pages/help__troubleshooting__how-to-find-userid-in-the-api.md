# How to find userID via API

1 min read

To retrieve the **userID** of a user, use the following endpoint:

**Endpoint**:

```
GEThttps://api.clockify.me/api/v1/user
```

This endpoint returns only the currently logged-in user.

To get all users or a specific user’s ID, use the `/v1/users` endpoint to fetch the full user list from the workspace.
