# I can’t find my workspace

3 min read

If your workspace seems to have disappeared, don’t worry; in most cases, it’s tied to your login details or workspace membership. This guide will help you check the most common causes and walk you through how to get back into your workspace quickly.

## You’re logged in with the wrong email address [#](#youre-logged-in-with-the-wrong-email-address)

Each Clockify account is tied to a specific email address. If you’re logged into a different account than the one used to join or create a workspace, you won’t see it listed.

What to do:

* Double-check which email you’re currently logged in with
* If you’re not sure which email you used for your workspace:
  + Check your email inboxes for any Clockify-related messages (e.g., invites, reports, etc.)
  + If you are part of a company workspace, ask your workspace admin to check your email address via the Team page

**Using Apple ID?**

* If you logged in or created an account using the “Continue with Apple” option, your account might be using Apple’s Private Relay feature, which generates a private, anonymized email (e.g., [random@privatereplay.appleid.com](mailto:random@privatereplay.appleid.com)).

* If you try to log in later using your real email address, it may not work because that email isn’t linked to your Clockify account.

Make sure you’re logging in with the same method you originally used (e.g., Continue with Apple, not manual login).

## You have multiple workspaces under the same account [#](#you-have-multiple-workspaces-under-the-same-account)

If you’re logged in with the right email address but still can’t find your workspace, it’s possible you have multiple workspaces and the wrong one is currently active.

To switch to another workspace:

1. Click on the workspace switcher located in the upper left corner of the screen
2. Browse through the list of workspaces to see if your missing workspace is listed here

## You’ve been removed from the workspace [#](#youve-been-removed-from-the-workspace)

If you’ve been removed from the workspace, you’ll be automatically logged out of it and redirected to your personal workspace.

To check:

* Open the notification bell (top-right corner)
* Look for a message: “You’ve been removed from the workspace.”

If that’s the case, reach out to your admin to be re-invited.
