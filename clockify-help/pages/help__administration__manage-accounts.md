# Manage users’ accounts

1 min read

Control accounts is a paid feature, which you can enable by [upgrading](https://clockify.me/pricing) your workspace to the Enterprise plan.

Gain complete control over users’ accounts on your workspace, so that you can:

* See when user joined
* Deactivate user’s API key
* Log in as user (if you’re on subdomain, you’ll only be able to log in as that user inside your workspace)
* Stop timer for another user

Only the workspace owner has access to the Accounts tab in the [Workspace settings](https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/workspaces#workspace-settings).

## Deactivate API key [#](#deactivate-api-key)

This page doesn’t display the API keys themselves, but it shows how many active keys each user has.

If you need to stop an API from working:

1. Click the **three-dots menu** next to the user whose API key you want to deactivate  
   ![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/deactivate_api_key.png)
2. Choose **Deactivate API key**
3. Click **Deactivate** to confirm the action

After being deactivated, that API key can no longer be used and its status will be automatically updated on the [Manage API keys](https://clockify.me/help/administration/profile-settings#manage-api-keys) page.
