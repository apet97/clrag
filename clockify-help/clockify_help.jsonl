When you record time in Clockify web, time from Profile Settings is used. Then, Clockify converts that time to UTC and sends the converted value to the server. When you later view the time in reports, the time zone from your Profile Settings is used.\n\nFor example:\n\n*Jörg from Germany works from 09-10 AM (UTC+2) and records that time in Clockify. Clockify converts it to 07-08 AM (its corresponding UTC value) and stores it in the database. When Emily from New York runs the report, she sees that Jörg worked from 03-04 AM (displayed in her UTC-4 time).*\n\nThis assumes the system time zone and the time zone in the Profile Settings match.

You have a 10-second window to undo the action.\n\nFor bulk edits, it’s always a good practice to double-check your changes before saving to avoid any issues.\n\n#### Can I bulk edit time entries for specific users or projects? [#](#can-i-bulk-edit-time-entries-for-specific-users-or-projects)\n\nYes, you can filter time entries by **project**, **user**, or **date range** before selecting which entries to bulk edit. This allows you to update only the relevant time entries without affecting others.\n\n* Simply use the **filter options** at the top of the Detailed Report or Time tracker page\n* Once you’ve filtered the data, click the checkbox to select all filtered entries\n* Then, proceed with your bulk edits\n\n#### What are “favorite” time entries, and how do I mark them? [#](#what-are-favorite-time-entries-and-how-do-i-mark-them)\n\n“Favorite” time entries allow you to easily access commonly used time entries. If you’re working on the same tasks or projects repeatedly, marking time entries as favorites will save time when tracking hours.\n\n1. After selecting the time entries you want to mark as favorites, click **Bulk Edit** and select the **Favorite** option.\n2. These entries will then be easy to access in the **Time Tracker** when adding new time.\n\n#### Can I bulk move time entries between workspaces? [#](#can-i-bulk-move-time-entries-between-workspaces)\n\nThis feature requires a paid plan.\n\nYes, you can bulk move time entries between workspaces by exporting the time entries as a **CSV** file and then importing them into a different workspace:\n\n1. Export the time entries from the **Detailed Report** in CSV format.\n2. Log in to the target workspace.\n3. Go to **Settings > Import** and upload the CSV.\n4. Follow the prompts to complete the import process.\n\n#### What happens if I make a bulk edit mistake on an entry that has a timer running? [#](#what-happens-if-i-make-a-bulk-edit-mistake-on-an-entry-that-has-a-timer-running)\n\nIf you are bulk editing time entries and accidentally modify one with a running timer, the changes will be applied once the timer is stopped. If the edit was a mistake, you can simply **undo** the action as long as it’s within the 10-second window.", "lang": "en"}

[#](#can-i-set-required-fields-for-individual-projects-or-tasks)\n\nNo, required fields are set at the **workspace level** and apply to **all time entries** across the workspace. This means you cannot designate different required fields for individual projects or tasks. For instance, if you mark the **Project** and **Tag** fields as required, then every user across all projects in the workspace will need to provide a project and a tag when logging time, regardless of the specific project or task. However, you can customize the required fields for your workspace as a whole by choosing which field (e.g. **Project**, **Task**, **Tag**, or **Description)** are mandatory for time entries.\n\n#### Can I disable required fields after enabling them? [#](#can-i-disable-required-fields-after-enabling-them)\n\nYes, you can modify the required fields at any time, but only **admins** have the permissions to do so. If you decide that certain fields no longer need to be mandatory (e.g. you no longer want the **Description** field to be required), you can go into the **Workspace settings** and disable that field. However, keep in mind that any changes made to the required fields will apply to **all future time entries**, and any time entries that were already submitted (even with missing information) will remain as they are.\n\n#### Can I use tags for more detailed reporting? [#](#can-i-use-tags-for-more-detailed-reporting)\n\nAbsolutely! Tags are a powerful tool for **categorizing** and **filtering** your time entries. By using tags consistently across your workspace, you can easily generate reports based on the tags you’ve assigned. For example, if you use tags for different project phases (e.g. Planning, Development, and Testing), you can filter your time entries to see how much time was spent in each phase. Similarly, tags can be used to differentiate between clients, types of work (e.g. Billable, Internal), or other relevant categories.\n\n#### Can required fields be applied to time entries logged via the mobile app or browser extension? [#](#can-required-fields-be-applied-to-time-entries-logged-via-the-mobile-app-or-browser-extension)\n\nYes, the **required fields** settings apply to time entries made across all platforms, including the **mobile app** and **browser extension**. If you attempt to log time via any device and the required fields (like **Project** or **Tag**) are not completed, you will be prompted to fill in the missing information before you can save the entry.\n\n#### How do required fields impact existing time entries? [#](#how-do-required-fields-impact-existing-time-entries)\n\nRequired fields only affect new or updated time entries after they are enabled. If the required fields are set up in the middle of a project, time entries that have already been logged will not retroactively require the fields. However, from the moment the required fields are activated, any **new time entries** or **updates to existing entries** will need to meet the new requirements. This ensures that moving forward, all data logged is complete and organized.\n\n#### Can I customize which users are affected by required fields? [#](#can-i-customize-which-users-are-affected-by-required-fields)\n\nNo, required fields apply to all users in the workspace once enabled, regardless of their role (e.g. Admin, Project Manager, Team Member).  \nFor additional assistance or to configure required fields and tags according to your workspace’s specific needs, you can always reach out to your **Workspace admin** or consult our **Help Center** for detailed instructions and best practices.", "lang": "en"}

Make sure to archive outdated policies if you want to keep the data intact.\n\n#### Can users see each other’s time off requests?\n\n**Admins** can view all time off requests. **Team managers** can view time off for their team members. **Regular users** can only view their own time off, unless the setting **Allow regular users to see time off outside their teams** is enabled.\n\n#### How are holidays treated in time off requests?\n\nHolidays and weekends are automatically excluded from the total time off. If an employee requests time off over a holiday or weekend, those days are not counted toward their leave balance.\n\n#### How do I assign a holiday to specific people?\n\nWhen creating or editing a holiday, you can assign it to specific users or groups. This allows you to set different holidays for different members (e.g. national holidays for one group, but not another).\n\n#### Can I approve or reject time off requests for my team?\n\nYes, as an Admin or Team manager, you can approve or reject time off requests for the users assigned to you.\n\n#### Can I track time off across multiple days?\n\nYes, if your time off policy is set to **days**, you can allow half-day leave across multiple days. If it’s set to **hours**, you can allow hourly requests across multiple days.\n\n#### Can I set up automatic accrual for time off policies?\n\nYes, you can configure time off to automatically accrue on a monthly or yearly basis for all team members covered by the policy.", "lang": "en"}

[#](#what-happens-if-i-dont-set-any-fields-as-required)\n\nIf you don’t set any fields as required, users can submit time entries without completing critical information like the project, task, or description. While this won’t prevent users from adding time entries, it can lead to incomplete or inconsistent data, making reporting and analysis more difficult.\n\n#### Can I make a custom field visible only for specific projects? [#](#can-i-make-a-custom-field-visible-only-for-specific-projects)\n\nYes, custom fields can be set to be visible only for specific projects. In **Project settings**, you can manage which custom fields should be visible and set default values for each project. Additionally, you can choose to make some fields visible only when a user selects a specific project.\n\n#### Can I make certain fields invisible to regular users? [#](#can-i-make-certain-fields-invisible-to-regular-users)\n\nYes, you can make certain fields **invisible** to regular users while still allowing them to track the data. Invisible fields can be used for metadata, project IDs, or backend integrations. Users won’t see these fields in their Time Tracker or Timesheet, but the data will still be available for reporting and can be used in exports or API integrations.\n\n#### Can required fields be used in reports? [#](#can-required-fields-be-used-in-reports)\n\nYes, required fields can be used in **reports**. When you export time entries to Excel or CSV, the required fields (and their values) will appear in the **Detailed report**. This allows you to filter and analyze time entries based on those required fields, ensuring you have consistent and complete data for reporting purposes.", "lang": "en"}

By default, these checkboxes are checked (blue with a white tick), indicating that the taxes are applied. Unchecking them means that taxes will **not** be applied to that particular item.\n\nTaxes are calculated in the following way:\n\n* **TAX**: This is calculated based on the percentage defined in the **Invoice Settings**\n* **TAX 2**: If enabled, this is also calculated as a percentage of the item amount\n\n#### Taxation mode [#](#taxation-mode)\n\nTaxation mode can be:\n\n* **Simple**: Both taxes are applied to the total amount of the item\n  + E.g.: For an item priced at $100, with **Tax 1** at 10% and **Tax 2** at 10%, the calculated taxes will be $10 for each, making the total $120.\n* **Compound**: The second tax is applied on the taxed amount, not the item amount.\n  + E.g.: For an item priced at $100, with **Tax 1** at 10% and **Tax 2** at 10%, **Tax 1** is $10, and **Tax 2** is calculated on the taxed amount, resulting in $11 for **Tax 2**, making the total $121.\n\nThe **checkboxes** for **TAX** and **TAX 2** are remembered for each item on the invoice, meaning that the selected state is retained until the invoice is manually edited or changes are made to the tax settings. If you change the tax percentage during invoice creation, the totals will update automatically to reflect the new tax rates.  \nIf you switch from **Simple** to **Compound** or vice versa, all **Unsent invoices** will automatically update to match the new taxation settings.\n\nFor example:\n\n* **Simple to Compound mode**: The **Apply tax** checkbox will appear next to each item\n* **Compound to simple mode**: The **Tax** and **Tax 2** checkboxes will reappear\n\n![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-2025-07-18-at-12.57.34-1024x608.png)\n\nIf you remove one of the taxes from an invoice, then selected taxation mode will also be removed.   \nIf you add a previously removed tax, the system will remember the last selected taxation mode for that invoice.\n\n#### Set taxation mode on individual invoices [#](#set-taxation-mode-on-individual-invoices)", "lang": "en"}

You can further subgroup it by Task. This way you’ll get a breakdown of your employees’ hours by specific tasks while working on certain project.\n\n![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/summary_report_group_by_user_project-1024x522.png)\n\nAnother useful way to view your employees’ hours is by grouping them by Date so you’ll see the total of hours each employee tracked per day.\n\nThis is great if you need to get a bi-weekly or monthly report of your team’s hours so the Weekly report doesn’t cut it.\n\n![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-20-at-15.36.14-1024x607.png)\n\nThis report has three levels of grouping so you can have a more granular view of your data.\n\nThe **Weekly report** is great if you check your employees’ hours each week so this is a set date range that works for you. You can also get a breakdown by User or Project.\n\n![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-20-at-15.41.45-1024x521.png)\n\nWhile there’s no option to change a date range in the Weekly report to show more than one week at a time, you can use the Summary report, select any date range at the top right corner of the page and group the report by User and Date to see the total of hours each employee tracked per day.\n\nThe **Detailed report** will let you see all the details of your team’s time entries one by one, not grouped or summarized. It’s also possible for an Admin to edit the team’s time entries in this report.\n\n![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/detailed-view-4-1024x553.png)\n\nYou can export any of the reports in PDF, Excel, CSV.", "lang": "en"}

You can even use multiple tags to filter reports with more precision.\n\nTags can also be used to add additional information to time entries. For example, you can:\n\n* Mark time entries with **non-standard billing rates or currencies** so you know how to invoice them\n* Mark **time entries you’ve invoiced** with **invoiced** tag so you don’t bill a client twice (you can use [bulk edit](https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/editing-time-entries#update-multiple-time-entries-in-a-bulk) to update multiple entries at once)\n* Mark what **type of work or service you provide** (e.g. project management, feedback, debugging, coding), so you can see how much time takes to perform a specific type of work across all projects\n* Mark what **part of business** you’re working on (e.g. internal, support, client work, mobile)\n* Mark the amount of time you worked **overtime**\n\nTags are useful because you can use them as keywords by which you can [filter](https://clockify.me/help/reports/filtering-reports) reports to find exactly what you need.\n\nBefore you can use tags, you have to create them by typing a new tag name in the tag picker and pressing **Ctrl / ^ (Control) + Enter**. Once you’ve created a tag, all users in your workspace can select it when tracking time.\n\nEveryone can create tags (though you can limit creation to Admins only in workspace settings).

Clockify can detect if you accidentally leave a timer running when you leave your desk, and let you remove the idle time so your timesheets stay accurate.\n\n![](https://clockify.me/help/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/idle_detection_new.png)\n\n#### How idle detection works [#](#how-idle-detection-works)\n\nIf there’s no mouse movement or keyboard strokes for X minutes, the timer will enter into idle mode. It will continue running, but it will treat those X minutes (and the time after that) as idle. When you become active, a notification will pop up, asking what you want to do with the idle time.\n\nYou can choose to:\n\n* **Discard idle time** – The timer will be stopped and the detected idle time will be removed from its total.\n* **Discard and continue** – The current timer will be stopped, the detected idle time will be removed from its total, and a new timer will immediately start for the same activity.\n* **Keep idle time** – The timer will keep running as it is. In order to keep idle time in the Chrome extension, simply close or dismiss the notification.\n\n**What will be discarded**:  If you’ve been active for 1h, inactive for 30m, and idle time is triggered after 15m, Clockify will discard 30m (time needed for the idle time to trigger and the time after that), leaving you with a 1h time entry.\n\nIf you’ve been away from the computer but stopped the timer via another device in the meantime, idle detection popup won’t appear.\n\nNote: idle detection can’t differentiate accidental mouse movements from normal activity. For example, if someone accidentally bumps into your desk while you’re away, idle detection will register the accidental movement as a normal activity.\n\n**How to set up idle detection on:**\n\n* [MacOS desktop app](https://clockify.me/help/apps/mac-desktop-app#detect-idle-time) (Note: if you’ve downloaded Clockify for Mac from the App Store, idle detection is not available.

Manual durations without precise timing\n\n\n\nInstead of specifying exact start and end times, users may enter total durations (e.g., “2 hours”), which can overlap with existing time entries if they don’t verify the timeframes.\n\n**Common scenarios**\n\n* A user starts a timer at 10:00 AM, then later manually logs time from 9:30 AM to 11:00 AM.\n* A user stops one timer and immediately starts another one (overlap happens here, usually with the compact mode enabled)\n* Multiple time entries are created with overlapping durations because users are unaware of existing entries", "lang": "en"}
